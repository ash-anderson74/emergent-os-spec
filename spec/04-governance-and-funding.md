# The Funding Model

Traditional funding models are built for predictability and control in low-uncertainty environments. They assume that scope, effort, and value can be forecast accurately. In contrast, EmergentOS implements an adaptive funding model, inspired by **The Startup Way ’s metered funding** and **EDGE ’s incremental investment**, which is designed for high-uncertainty, fast-changing environments, where **learning, experimentation, and customer impact** are the true indicators of success.

## Adaptive Funding Model: Investing in Outcomes, Not Outputs

1. Strategic Framing via Lean Value Trees

- Funding begins with **strategic themes** and **bets** (or what Eric Ries refers to as *Leap of Faith Assumptions*) defined in **Lean Value Trees (LVTs)**.  
- Each bet is a **hypothesis** about where investment will drive measurable outcomes.  
- Initiatives are prioritized based on **expected value**, not effort or scope.

  *“If we invest in X, we expect to see Y outcome, because Z.”*  

2. Metered Funding via Hypothesis Validation

- Initiatives receive **initial funding tranches** to support **discovery and experimentation**.  
- Teams use this to validate feasibility, desirability, and viability.  
- Only after validation do teams make **High Integrity Commitments** , unlocking further funding.  

3. Outcome-Based Investment via OKRs

- Funding is tied to **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**, not feature lists.
- OKRs define the **measurable change** the investment is expected to produce.
- Progress is reviewed quarterly, using telemetry and flow metrics—not status reports.

4. Flow-Based Governance via Portfolio Kanban

- **Portfolio Kanban** visualizes initiative flow, dependencies, and WIP limits.
- Leaders use **flow and outcome signals** to coach teams and reallocate funding dynamically.
- Initiatives that stall or fail to validate assumptions can be paused, pivoted, or retired.

  *This replaces deterministic budgeting with **empirical, adaptive governance**.*  

5. Quarterly Cadence for Funding Decisions

- Funding decisions are made during **Slowification  windows** (Weeks 1–2 and Week 12).
- Teams present validated hypotheses, outcome telemetry, and improvement OKRs.
- Leadership reviews **evidence, not estimates**, to guide investment.

6. Innovation Accounting Integration

- EmergentOS supports **three levels of innovation accounting**:
  - **Learning Metrics**: e.g. experiment velocity, discovery outcomes.
  - **Behavioural Metrics**: e.g. user engagement, conversion rates.
  - **Business Metrics**: e.g. revenue impact, cost reduction.
- These are tracked via **telemetry dashboards, OKRs,** and **Flow Metrics**.

The EmergentOS funding model transforms investment from a static, upfront allocation into a dynamic, evidence-based process that evolves with learning. By tying funding to validated hypotheses, measurable outcomes, and flow-based governance, it enables organizations to invest in what works—while safely stopping what doesn’t. This approach empowers teams, accelerates innovation, and ensures that every pound spent is traceable to strategic impact. In doing so, EmergentOS turns funding into a **strategic lever for adaptability, not a constraint on it**.

## Budgeting Guidance for Adaptive Funding in EmergentOS

This section provides practical guidance for finance and portfolio teams transitioning from traditional budgeting approaches to the **adaptive, outcome-driven funding model** used in EmergentOS. It outlines how to align financial planning with strategic agility, validated learning, and continuous value delivery.

 1. Budgeting by Strategic Theme and Lean Value Tree Branches

- Allocate budgets to **strategic themes** and **Lean Value Tree branches**, not fixed projects.
- Treat each branch as a **portfolio of bets**—each with its own hypothesis and outcome targets.
- Enable **modular funding** that can be scaled up or down based on validated progress.

2. Use Metered Funding Tranches

- Replace large upfront allocations with **metered funding tranches** released quarterly.
- Initial tranches support **discovery and experimentation**.
- Subsequent tranches are contingent on **validated learning**, telemetry, and High Integrity Commitments.

  This reduces financial risk and increases responsiveness to change.

3. Tie Funding to OKRs and Outcomes

- Require teams to define **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** before receiving funding.
- Key Results should reflect **customer impact, business performance, or flow improvement**.
- Use OKR progress as a signal for continued investment—not just delivery status.

4. Enable Dynamic Reallocation

- Use **Portfolio Kanban** and **Flow Metrics** to monitor initiative health and progress.
- Reallocate funding dynamically based on: 
  - Hypothesis validation
  - Outcome achievement
  - Flow efficiency
  - Strategic shifts

  This supports continuous prioritization and avoids sunk cost traps.

5. Support Innovation Accounting

- Track funding against **three levels of innovation accounting**:
  - **Learning Metrics** (e.g. experiment velocity)
  - **Behavioural Metrics** (e.g. user engagement)
  - **Business Metrics** (e.g. revenue impact)
- Use these metrics to assess return on learning before traditional ROI is visible.

6. Align Budgeting Cadence with EmergentOS Quarterly Cycle

- Sync budgeting reviews with **Slowification windows** (Weeks 1–2 and Week 12).
- Use these windows to:
  - Review validated learning
  - Assess OKR progress
  - Adjust funding allocations
  - Plan next quarter’s investments

7. Empower Teams with Guardrails

- Empower teams to make local investment decisions within **defined guardrails**:
  - Budget caps per initiative
  - Outcome-based funding gates
  - Shared telemetry dashboards

This decentralizes decision-making while maintaining financial discipline.
EmergentOS budgeting shifts the focus from predictive control to adaptive enablement. Finance and portfolio teams become strategic partners in learning, innovation, and value delivery—ensuring that every investment is traceable to outcomes, not just activity.
