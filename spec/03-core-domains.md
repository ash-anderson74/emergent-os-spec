# Core Domains

Each domain within the operating system represents a dimension of adaptation – where change, learning, and alignment occur in a complex socio-technical system.

| Domain                   | Focus                                                        | Core Question                                   | Primary Levers                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direction & Purpose      | Strategy and shared outcomes                                 | Why are we adapting?                            | Mission clarity, adaptive strategy, outcome definition, sensing mechanisms                                        |
| Leadership & Culture     | Behaviours, values, and psychological conditions             | How do we lead and learn together?              | Leadership models, decision rights, trust, learning culture, psychological safety                                 |
| Product & Value Creation | Discovery, delivery, and validation of value                 | How do we create and evolve value continuously? | Product operating model, empowered teams, discovery practices, outcome metrics                                    |
| Flow & Enablement        | Technical and organizational infrastructure for adaptability | How do we make adaptation possible and safe?    | Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, automation, architecture, toolchains, system design for flow |
| Learning & Sensing       | Feedback loops and systemic learning                         | How do we know what is working and what is not? | Retrospectives, reflection, experimentation, data feedback, sensing networks                                      |

## Domain Relationships

These domains are interdependent and cyclic rather than hierarchical:

Each domain feeds the next:

* Purpose defines intent
* Leadership shapes the environment for teams
* Product teams create adaptive value
* Flow enables responsiveness
* Learning feeds insight back into strategy and culture

Across these domains, EmergentOS emphasises a few universal principles:

* Empowerment over control
* Outcomes over outputs
* Learning over certainty
* Trust over compliance
* Flow over friction
* Systems thinking over silos
