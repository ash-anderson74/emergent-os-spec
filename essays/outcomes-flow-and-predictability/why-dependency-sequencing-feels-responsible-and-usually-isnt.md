# Why Dependency Sequencing Feels Responsible — and Usually Isn’t

Product managers are often asked to do something impossible.

They are asked to:

* identify dependencies in advance
* estimate work across teams
* sequence delivery for the quarter
* and commit to dates

This expectation is well-intentioned. It comes from a desire to reduce risk.

The problem is that **dependency sequencing assumes certainty that does not exist**.

#### The Hidden Assumption

When we build dependency-based plans, we assume:

* the dependency is real and stable
* the interface is understood
* the other team’s work will unfold as expected
* nothing important will be discovered along the way

In new products, migrations, or architectural change, these assumptions are rarely justified.

#### Why PMs Still Do It

Because within most systems:

* not having a sequence feels negligent
* saying “we don’t know yet” feels unsafe
* uncertainty is interpreted as lack of control

Dependency sequencing becomes a **coping mechanism**, not a truth-telling tool.

#### A Different PM Value Proposition

In EOM terms, PMs create the most value **before delivery begins**, by:

* surfacing assumptions instead of hiding them
* exposing dependency risk early
* designing cheap ways to learn
* sequencing risk collapse, not output
* resisting false confidence

This doesn’t make PMs less rigorous.

It makes them **more responsible**.

#### The Shift

From:

> “Here’s the plan and the dependency chain”

To:

> **“Here’s what must be learned before this plan becomes safe”**

That is not a retreat from accountability.\
It is accountability _without fiction_.
