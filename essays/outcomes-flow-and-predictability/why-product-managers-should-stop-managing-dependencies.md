# Why Product Managers Should Stop “Managing Dependencies”

Product managers are often expected to answer impossible questions early:

* _What are the dependencies?_
* _How risky is this plan?_
* _Can we commit with confidence?_

These questions are reasonable — but the way organisations expect them to be answered is not.

In complex product environments, dependencies do not behave like items on a checklist. They behave like **relationships**, **queues**, **decisions**, and **delays** — none of which can be fully understood without interaction.

***

### Why Dependency Identification Fails PMs

The traditional approach assumes that:

* dependencies are stable
* risk can be enumerated
* effort can be inferred
* confidence precedes action

This puts PMs in a bind.

If they surface uncertainty honestly, they appear unprepared.\
If they present a polished plan, they absorb risk personally.

Dependency lists become a coping mechanism.

They create the appearance of due diligence while silently transferring uncertainty into the future.

***

### What PMs Actually Control

PMs do not control most dependencies.

They _do_ control:

* where attention is placed
* what gets tested first
* how uncertainty is framed
* whether learning is legitimised
* when the organisation commits

The mistake is treating dependencies as coordination problems rather than **learning problems**.

***

### A Better Question to Ask Early

Instead of:

> _“What are all the dependencies?”_

Ask:

> **“Which assumption, if wrong, would most damage our ability to proceed?”**

That question reframes planning from reassurance to discovery.

***

### Learning Before Commitment Is the PM Skill

In EOM terms, PMs create value early by:

* articulating assumptions explicitly
* identifying where confidence is borrowed
* designing cheap experiments to reduce uncertainty
* sequencing work to collapse risk first
* resisting false certainty

This is not indecision.\
It is disciplined risk management.

***

### Why “Provoking” a Dependency Is a Product Responsibility

When PMs hear _“provoke dependencies”_, it can sound reckless — as if the suggestion is to create instability or force conflict between teams.

That is not what is meant.

Provoking a dependency does **not** mean:

* interrupting other teams
* ignoring coordination
* starting work prematurely
* creating artificial blockers

It means doing something more fundamental:

> **Deliberately forcing a dependency to reveal what it does not yet know about itself.**

This is not chaos.\
It is disciplined exposure.

***

### The Hidden Problem with “Managing” Dependencies

When dependencies are “managed”, they are typically:

* catalogued
* sequenced
* owned by someone
* deferred to the right point in the plan

This creates the appearance of safety.

But from an EOM perspective, it does something dangerous:

> **It converts uncertainty into scheduling logic.**

The dependency still exists.\
The risk still exists.\
But discovery is postponed until delivery is already underway.

PMs feel productive because the dependency is _accounted for_.\
The system becomes fragile because it is not _understood_.

***

### What Dependencies Actually Represent

A dependency is not a thing to be waited on.

It is a signal that:

* assumptions cross team boundaries
* knowledge is incomplete
* feedback loops are too long
* ownership is fragmented
* risk is being displaced rather than reduced

From this perspective, a dependency is not a coordination problem.\
It is a **learning problem**.

And learning problems are squarely within the PM’s domain.

***

### What “Provoking” a Dependency Really Means

To provoke a dependency is to **interact with it early, cheaply, and deliberately** in order to answer questions like:

* What assumptions does this dependency rely on?
* What would break if those assumptions are wrong?
* Where would learning surface fastest?
* How reversible are we right now?

Examples of provocation include:

* testing an integration path with a minimal spike
* migrating a single workflow before committing to a full cutover
* validating data contracts with real payloads
* exercising edge cases long before feature completeness
* exposing cross-team coupling through partial use, not negotiation

What matters is not the technique, but the intent:

> **Expose reality before the plan depends on it.**

***

### Why This Is a PM Job (Not an Engineering Detail)

Engineers can build experiments.\
Architects can anticipate failure modes.\
Teams can coordinate execution.

But **PMs are uniquely positioned to decide where uncertainty must collapse first**.

This is because PMs operate at the intersection of:

* customer impact
* strategic intent
* investment decision-making
* narrative commitment

When PMs sequence work to “manage” dependencies, they often do so to protect:

* roadmaps
* stakeholder confidence
* quarterly commitments
* perceived momentum

When PMs provoke dependencies, they deliberately risk _local discomfort_ to prevent _systemic failure_.

That trade-off is a product decision, not a delivery one.

***

### Why Provocation Feels Unsafe — and Why That Matters

Provoking a dependency usually produces:

* bad news earlier
* awkward conversations sooner
* partial invalidation of plans
* visible uncertainty

In many organisations, this is personally risky.

Which is exactly why dependency provocation is rare — and why dependency management dominates instead.

EOM does not assume PMs lack insight.

It assumes the system makes **deferral safer than exposure**.

This essay exists to name that reality — not to judge it.

***

### Reframing the PM Role Under EOM

Under EOM, PMs create value early not by sequencing certainty, but by collapsing uncertainty.

They do this by:

* choosing exposure over coordination
* learning before committing narrative
* turning dependencies into discovery mechanisms
* making risk visible while it is still cheap

This does not eliminate planning.

It prevents planning from standing in for learning.

***

### A Final Reframe

A useful shift for PMs is to stop asking:

> “How do we plan around this dependency?”

And start asking:

> **“What would we need to learn for this dependency to stop being scary?”**

That question changes the work.

And when the work changes early enough,\
the plan often becomes simpler — without anyone having to manage it.

***

### In Closing

Dependencies do not become manageable when they are documented.

They become manageable when they are **experienced early, cheaply, and deliberately**.

When PMs are allowed to shift from dependency management to dependency exposure:

* plans improve
* confidence becomes earned
* surprises shrink
* and delivery accelerates — not because people try harder, but because reality is faced sooner

That is not weaker planning.

It is **planning that respects complexity**.
