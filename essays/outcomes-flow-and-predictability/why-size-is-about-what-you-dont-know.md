# Why Size Is About What You Don’t Know

Product managers are routinely asked to size work.

Not roughly.\
Not directionally.\
But _confidently_.

The assumption underneath most sizing conversations is simple and rarely questioned:

> **If we size the work carefully enough, we can reduce uncertainty.**

In complex product environments, this assumption is wrong.

Worse, it often produces the opposite effect.

This essay explains why size is not a statement of effort, time, or team capacity — but a signal of **how much uncertainty remains**, and how treating it that way fundamentally changes planning, sequencing, and delivery behaviour.

***

### The Real Reason We Size Work

In theory, sizing exists to help with:

* prioritisation
* capacity awareness
* coordination

In practice, sizing is often used to:

* justify delivery timelines
* support funding decisions
* sequence cross-team dependencies
* create an illusion of control

None of those objectives are inherently unreasonable.

The problem arises when **uncertainty is translated into numbers** and then treated as a commitment.

At that point, size stops being informative — and starts being performative.

***

### Size Does Not Measure Work. It Measures Confidence.

In complex systems, size cannot reliably represent:

* how long something will take
* how difficult it will be
* how many surprises exist

What it _can_ represent — if used honestly — is:

> **How well we understand the problem and its solution right now.**

That makes size a _knowledge signal_, not a delivery promise.

When a team says something is “small”, what they are really saying is:

* the problem is well understood
* the solution is known or proven
* the path is familiar
* the risk of discovery is low

When a team says something is “large”, they are saying the opposite.

That information is far more valuable than a time estimate — if the system allows it to be used honestly.

***

### An Example: Sizing as a Signal of Confidence, Not Effort

One practical way teams can size work without pretending to predict the future is to use **T-shirt sizes as indicators of current understanding**, not delivery effort.

In this framing, size communicates _confidence_, not time.

Here is an example of how the same sizes can be understood in two complementary ways:

| Size   | Friendly Team Description                                                                                | Systems / EOM Interpretation                                                                                                                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **XS** | Trivial, quick, and easy                                                                                 | The problem and solution are both well understood. Risk is low, unknowns are minimal, and execution dominates learning.                          |
| **S**  | Very well understood problem; solution is known; work is straightforward                                 | Confidence is grounded in prior experience. Most uncertainty has already been resolved elsewhere. Delivery is largely repeatable.                |
| **M**  | The problem is understood; there are ideas for a solution but investigation is required; some complexity | The intent is clear, but learning is still required. Assumptions exist about feasibility, integration, or behaviour that must be tested.         |
| **L**  | Some ambiguity or uncertainty; the solution requires research or investigation; highly complex           | Significant unknowns remain. Dependencies, architectural implications, or user behaviour are unclear. Execution without learning would be risky. |
| **XL** | Too big — requires spikes or breakdown before delivery                                                   | Confidence is insufficient for commitment. This is a signal to stop planning delivery and start learning work to reduce uncertainty.             |

Read this table vertically, not horizontally.

The sizes are not a scale of _difficulty_.\
They are a gradient of _unknowns_.

### Why This Changes Planning Behaviour

Used this way, sizing stops being a negotiation and becomes a diagnosis.

An **L** or **XL** item is not a failure of refinement — it’s an honest signal that:

* knowledge is missing
* risk is concentrated
* confidence would be borrowed if work began immediately

The correct response is not to _force certainty_, but to ask:

> **What would we need to learn for this to become smaller?**

That question leads naturally to:

* spikes instead of stories
* probes instead of plans
* experiments instead of commitments

As learning occurs, size should shrink _without pressure_.

That shrinkage is progress.

***

### What This Avoids (Deliberately)

This approach avoids several common traps:

* No implied duration
* No velocity maths
* No cross-team comparability
* No hidden commitments

Most importantly, it prevents size from becoming a proxy for _delivery promises_.

Once size is tied to deadlines, sequencing, or funding, it stops being a learning signal and becomes a political one.

***

### The Critical Test

You can tell whether sizing is serving the system by watching what happens to **large items**.

If large items trigger:

* escalation
* pressure to estimate
* artificial splitting
* optimistic re-sizing

…then the system is punishing honesty.

If large items trigger:

* curiosity
* learning work
* reduced scope of commitment
* earlier discovery

…then sizing is doing its job.

***

### In EOM Terms

This kind of sizing aligns cleanly with EOM principles:

* **Outcomes over outputs** — size reflects uncertainty, not activity
* **Learning over certainty** — large sizes legitimise discovery work
* **Evidence over opinion** — confidence increases only through learning
* **Incremental commitment** — delivery follows confidence, not hope

Size becomes a design tool — not a planning crutch.

***

### Why Large Sizes Exist (and Why That’s Good)

Large items are often treated as failures of refinement.

In reality, they are **warnings**.

Large size usually indicates:

* unclear requirements
* architectural uncertainty
* cross-team coupling
* hidden dependencies
* novel user behaviour
* regulatory or integration risk

Attempting to “size these down” prematurely doesn’t remove uncertainty.

It just hides it.

A system that treats large sizes as delivery candidates is incentivising teams to **borrow confidence they don’t actually have**.

***

### Why “XL Means Stop” Is a Feature, Not a Bug

In an EOM-aligned system, some sizes should block execution.

When an item is _too large_, the correct response is not:

* stronger commitment
* better estimation
* more coordination

It is:

> **Learning work instead of delivery work.**

Spikes, probes, technical experiments, user tests, or architectural thin slices exist to change the _knowledge state_ of the problem.

Once uncertainty is reduced, size changes naturally.

If size is shrinking because knowledge is increasing, the system is working.

If size is shrinking because pressure is increasing, it isn’t.

***

### Why Estimation Becomes Dangerous Under Pressure

Problems emerge when size is used for things it cannot safely support:

* sequencing across teams
* deterministic roadmaps
* dependency management
* portfolio commitments
* performance comparison

Under these conditions:

* large sizes become liabilities
* small sizes become currency
* confidence is rewarded over honesty
* learning is quietly deferred

Teams adapt rationally.

They break work artificially.\
They underestimate risk.\
They smooth narratives.\
They optimise for delivery optics.

This is not a cultural problem.\
It is a system design problem.

***

### Reframing the PM Role

In a learning-centred system, the PM’s value is not in _predicting_ delivery.

It’s in **collapsing uncertainty early**.

That means PMs create value by:

* articulating assumptions explicitly
* identifying where confidence is borrowed
* designing cheap experiments
* sequencing work to reveal risk early
* resisting pressure to turn unknowns into plans

Size becomes one of the tools that makes uncertainty visible — not something PMs are expected to eliminate.

***

### What Healthy Sizing Behaviour Looks Like

In systems where sizing supports learning:

* Large items trigger curiosity, not escalation
* Teams can say “we don’t know yet” without penalty
* Learning work is funded and planned explicitly
* Size changes are seen as progress, not churn
* Nobody asks, “how long is a large?”

The question becomes:

> **What would we need to learn for this to become smaller?**

That is a planning question worth answering.

***

### In Summary

Size does not create certainty.

Size reveals how much certainty is missing.

When sizing is treated as a knowledge signal:

* planning becomes more honest
* dependencies surface earlier
* risk is reduced sooner
* flow improves naturally

When sizing is treated as a delivery promise, learning slows — and surprises compound.

If your sizing conversations are tense, political, or defensive, it’s rarely because teams are bad at estimating.

It’s because the system has turned uncertainty into a liability.

And uncertainty, in product work, is not the enemy.

Pretending it isn’t there is.
