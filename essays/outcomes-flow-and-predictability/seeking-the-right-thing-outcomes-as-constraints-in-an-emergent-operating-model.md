# Seeking the Right Thing: Outcomes as Constraints in an Emergent Operating Model

In _Thinking in Systems_, Donella Meadows describes a systems trap she calls **“Seeking the Wrong Thing.”**\
The trap is subtle and pervasive: a system pursues its goals with increasing efficiency, yet moves further away from its true purpose. The system does not fail due to lack of discipline or effort — it fails _because it is faithfully executing the intent encoded into it_.

The Emergent Operating Model (EOM) treats this trap not as a cautionary tale, but as a **design concern**. If a system reliably produces undesirable outcomes, the question is not _“Why are people behaving incorrectly?”_ but _“What is the system optimised to do?”_

***

### The Core Failure Mode: Confusing Signals with Intent

Complex adaptive systems cannot be directly controlled. They can only be **influenced** through constraints, feedback loops, and signals. Metrics exist for one reason only: **to inform judgment**.

When a metric is elevated from signal to target, it ceases to function as feedback and becomes a **control variable**. This transition marks the beginning of the “seeking the wrong thing” trap.

Goodhart’s Law captures the mechanism succinctly:\
&#xNAN;_&#x57;hen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure._

In EOM terms, this is not a philosophical concern — it is a structural one. The system adapts to what it is constrained to optimise. Once a proxy is treated as intent, the system will optimise the proxy, even when doing so undermines the system’s purpose.

***

### Deployment Frequency as a Canonical Example

Consider deployment frequency. In a healthy delivery system, deployment frequency can act as a **learning signal** — correlated with small batch sizes, faster feedback, and reduced risk.

But when deployment frequency is institutionalised as a target — particularly when tied to performance evaluation or incentives — it becomes detached from its original meaning. Behaviour adapts accordingly:

* Deployments are artificially split
* Trivial changes are prioritised
* Value delivery becomes secondary to deployability

The system has not malfunctioned. It has **converged on its constraint**.

This distinction is foundational to EOM:

> Systems do not respond to purpose statements; they respond to constraints.

***

### Effort Is Not Achievement

Meadows also highlights a second, reinforcing error: **mistaking effort for achievement**.

Effort is attractive to systems because it is:

* Visible
* Countable
* Easily attributed

Outcomes, by contrast, are:

* Often lagging
* Contextual
* Dependent on external behaviour

As a result, poorly constrained systems drift toward optimising activity instead of impact. Output becomes the proxy for progress, and progress becomes the justification for continued investment.

EOM treats this as a **diagnostic smell**: when effort is rewarded independently of outcome, the system is operating without a meaningful constraint on purpose.

***

### Outcomes in EOM: Constraints, Not Goals

A central principle of the Emergent Operating Model is that **outcomes are not goals to be achieved**. They are **constraints that shape system evolution**.

This distinction matters deeply.

* **Goals** imply predictability, linear causality, and control.
* **Constraints** preserve direction while allowing adaptation.

In a complex adaptive system, specifying _how_ an outcome must be achieved collapses optionality and destroys learning. Specifying _what must be true for the system to be valuable_ preserves coherence without prescribing implementation.

Outcomes therefore function as:

* **Boundary conditions** for decision-making
* **Fitness criteria** for experiments
* **Guardrails** against local optimisation

They do not define success as a point in time. They define **what the system must not violate** as it evolves.

***

### OKRs and KPIs in an Emergent System

Much of the confusion surrounding OKRs and KPIs stems from treating them as interchangeable instruments of control. In EOM, their roles are clearly distinct.

#### KPIs: Observational Signals

KPIs describe the _current behaviour of the system_. They are descriptive, not prescriptive. Their value lies in trend analysis, anomaly detection, and sense-making.

KPIs answer the question:\
&#xNAN;**“What is the system doing, and what patterns are emerging?”**

Once KPIs are used to evaluate individual or team performance, their diagnostic value collapses. The system begins to perform _for the measurement_, not for the outcome.

#### OKRs: Directional Hypotheses

OKRs express _intent to change the system_. Properly framed, they are hypotheses about leverage, not delivery commitments.

In EOM-aligned OKRs:

* The **Objective** articulates an outcome constraint
* The **Key Results** describe observable behavioural or systemic change
* Success is learning, not completion

OKRs answer the question:\
&#xNAN;**“If we act here, do we believe the system will evolve in this direction?”**

When OKRs become performance contracts, the organisation exits learning mode and enters compliance mode — a fundamental violation of EOM principles.

***

### The Reinforcing Trap Structure

The “Seeking the Wrong Thing” trap follows a recognisable feedback pattern:

1. A proxy for value is selected
2. The proxy becomes a target
3. Behaviour adapts to optimise the proxy
4. Proxy performance improves
5. Confidence in the proxy increases
6. Structural dependence forms
7. Divergence from real outcomes grows

At this point, corrective signals are often dismissed as anecdotal or inconvenient. The system becomes **structurally committed to the wrong thing**.

EOM treats this not as a cultural problem, but as an architectural one.

***

### Reasserting Purpose Through Constraint

The corrective action is not to remove metrics, nor to demand better behaviour. It is to **restore the primacy of outcomes as constraints** and to demote metrics back to their rightful place as signals.

An EOM-aligned system therefore:

* Uses metrics to prompt inquiry, not judgment
* Uses OKRs to explore direction, not declare success
* Treats outcomes as non-negotiable boundaries of value
* Accepts emergence as a feature, not a failure

This preserves both accountability _and_ adaptability — without resorting to brittle control mechanisms.

***

### Conclusion: Designing Systems That Seek the Right Thing

Every system seeks what it is constrained to seek.

If constrained by activity, it will maximise effort.\
If constrained by metrics, it will game measures.\
If constrained by outcomes, it will adapt intelligently within boundaries of purpose.

The task of leadership, then, is not to define better targets — but to design **better constraints**.

This is why EOM treats governance as constraint design, not performance management.

When outcomes are treated as system constraints rather than goals to be achieved, organisations stop mistaking motion for progress and begin evolving toward the value they exist to create.

That is what it means, in an Emergent Operating Model, to _seek the right thing_.
