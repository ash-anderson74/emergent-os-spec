# Why Organisations Lie to Themselves (Systemically)

Organisations rarely lie deliberately.

More often, they tell themselves stories that gradually replace reality — until those stories feel safer, simpler, and more actionable than the truth.

From the outside, this can look like denial, spin, or bad faith. From the inside, it is usually something else entirely.

It is **systemic self-deception**.

***

### This Is Not About Dishonesty

Most organisational self-deception is not malicious.

It emerges when:

* uncertainty is high
* stakes are visible
* accountability is asymmetric
* reversibility is limited
* and explanation is demanded before evidence exists

Under these conditions, _honest uncertainty becomes expensive_.

What replaces it is not a lie, but a **premature narrative**.

### The Subtle Shift: From Hypothesis to Story

In adaptive work, early decisions are necessarily provisional.

They begin as:

* hypotheses
* bets
* assumptions
* incomplete explanations

But organisations do not operate comfortably on “we’re not sure yet”.

So provisional decisions are quickly reframed as:

* strategies
* commitments
* plans
* narratives

The moment this shift occurs, something changes:

> Evidence no longer updates the story.\
> The story begins to interpret the evidence.

This is the beginning of systemic self-deception.

### Why Narratives Become Safer Than Signals

Narratives perform important functions:

* they reduce anxiety
* they coordinate action
* they create coherence
* they enable explanation

But they also have side effects.

Once a narrative exists:

* changing direction threatens credibility
* uncertainty becomes reputational risk
* learning becomes destabilising
* stopping becomes failure

At this point, **defensibility replaces accuracy** as the governing logic.

Reality is not rejected. It is negotiated.

### Metric Certainty as a Refuge

When narratives feel fragile, organisations often retreat into metrics.

Not because metrics are truthful — but because they are **legible**.

Metrics provide:

* distance from judgement
* protection from blame
* plausible deniability
* a sense of control

This is why organisations under pressure often:

* over-specify targets
* defend indicators instead of outcomes
* optimise numbers while missing reality
* confuse measurement with understanding

In EOM terms, this is not misuse. It is **the rational response to metric-driven accountability**.

***

### The Social Cost of Being Right Too Early

Ironically, the highest cost is often paid by those closest to reality.

People who surface:

* disconfirming data
* early risks
* uncomfortable truths
* invalidated assumptions

often experience:

* loss of influence
* social friction
* reputational damage
* exclusion from future decisions

Over time, the organisation learns a lesson:

> _Truth that arrives at the wrong moment is dangerous._

This is how silence becomes rational. This is how learning slows. This is how self-deception stabilises.

***

### How Self-Deception Becomes Structural

No single person chooses this outcome.

It emerges when:

* commitments are public and irreversible
* funding depends on confidence
* bonuses depend on metrics
* narratives protect reputations
* governance rewards reassurance

At that point, honesty becomes a liability and coherence matters more than correctness.

The organisation is not lying.

It is **operating exactly as designed**.

***

### The EOM Reframe

The Emergent Operating Model does not attempt to “fix honesty”.

It changes the **conditions under which honesty is survivable**.

Specifically, EOM works to ensure that:

* commitments remain incremental and reversible
* learning is legitimate before certainty
* funding can stop without blame
* metrics inform inquiry, not judgement
* governance senses rather than enforces
* narratives remain provisional

In this environment, the system no longer requires self-deception to function.

Reality becomes usable again.

***

### The Uncomfortable Truth

Organisations do not lie because they are unethical.

They lie because:

* truth arrives before safety
* evidence arrives after commitment
* learning arrives after reputation is at stake

Until those dynamics change, no amount of transparency, values, or exhortation will help.

The problem is not integrity. The problem is design.

***

### In Closing

Systemic self-deception is not a failure of courage.

It is the predictable outcome of systems that:

* reward certainty
* punish revision
* confuse explanation with control

If you want organisations to tell the truth, you must design environments where **the truth can arrive early, safely, and usefully**.

That is not a moral challenge.

It is an operating challenge.
