# Why the Emergent Operating Model Exists

> _“Rather than the domain of work being repetitive, knowable, and deterministic with known-unknowns (you know how to fix it if something goes wrong), unique product development is unknowable and **emergent** with unknown-unknowns instead. For something that has not been done before, you don’t know what you don’t know until you do something and get feedback.”_\

The Emergent Operating Model did not begin as an attempt to invent something new.

It emerged from a repeated, frustrating observation inside a real organisation:\
**deterministic planning practices kept reasserting themselves in environments where outcomes were inherently uncertain.**

Despite widespread awareness of modern product thinking, business agility, and DevOps principles, the organisation continued to optimise for predictability, control, and upfront certainty. Planning artefacts multiplied. Dependencies grew. Confidence was demanded before learning was possible.

Everyone involved understood—intellectually—that this was not how successful product development worked.\
Yet the organisation behaved as if it were the only rational option.

This contradiction was the starting point.

### The Limits of “Better Practices”

At the team level, the literature was clear and compelling.

* Empowered, cross-functional teams
* Discovery before delivery
* Outcomes over outputs
* Learning over certainty

These ideas were not controversial. In fact, many were already familiar and partially adopted.

What was missing was not knowledge of _what good looks like_, but an explanation of **why it failed to survive contact with the organisation**.

New practices were introduced, but the underlying system continued to reward old behaviours. Teams learned quickly where risk actually sat, which signals leaders trusted, and which commitments were truly non-negotiable. Unsurprisingly, behaviour aligned to those realities rather than to aspirational intent.

The problem was not insufficient agility.\
The problem was an operating model that made non-adaptive behaviour rational.

### Determinism as a System Equilibrium

Deterministic planning did not persist because people preferred it.

It persisted because the organisation’s structures, incentives, governance, and funding assumptions treated the following as reasonable:

* work could be reliably predicted
* risk could be pushed downward
* certainty was a prerequisite for trust
* coordination was safer than autonomy

Within that operating model:

* demanding upfront plans was sensible
* escalating dependencies was logical
* defensive commitments were rational
* reversion was inevitable

No amount of coaching or training could override those forces.

The Emergent Operating Model exists to make that equilibrium visible — and therefore changeable.

### Why an Operating Model, Not a Framework

This is why the Emergent Operating Model could not be another framework, methodology, or packaged transformation.

Frameworks attempt to change behaviour by prescription.\
Operating models shape behaviour by altering **defaults**.

EOM was created to articulate the system-level conditions under which modern product development and business agility can actually function. It defines what must remain true about decision-making, learning, flow, and governance if new behaviours are to persist without constant enforcement.

Rather than telling teams what to do, it asks a harder question:

> _What conditions make the current behaviour inevitable — and what would need to change for better behaviour to become the default?_

### From Product Environments to Generalisation

Complex product and technology environments surface these issues first.

Fast feedback, uncertain outcomes, and tight coupling between technical and human systems make misaligned assumptions painfully visible. When learning is slow and commitments are premature, failure arrives quickly and at scale.

The Emergent Operating Model generalises outward from these environments — not by abstracting away their realities, but by preserving the constraints they expose.

***

### In Summary

The Emergent Operating Model exists because:

* deterministic planning fails predictably in complex environments
* behavioural change does not stick without systemic change
* frameworks alone cannot override organisational defaults
* learning must be treated as a governing mechanism, not a by-product

EOM does not promise agility.

It exists to explain **why agility so often fails** — and what must change for the next attempt to be credible.
