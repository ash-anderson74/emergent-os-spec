# A Boardroom Dialogue on Business Agility and Systemic Change

**Participants**

* **Board Member / CFO (BM)** — focused on predictability, control, and fiduciary risk
* **Executive Sponsor for Change (ESC)** — accountable for long-term adaptability and customer value

#### “Why should the board even consider this?”

**BM:**\
We already approve strategy, budgets, and delivery plans. From a governance perspective, the organisation is functioning. What problem are you asking us to address?

**ESC:**\
The problem isn’t whether we are delivering work.\
It’s whether the system that governs delivery reliably produces the outcomes we expect — and whether it adapts when evidence says it won’t.

Right now, we convert uncertainty into certainty very early, and then manage adherence to that certainty rather than learning whether it was justified.

***

#### “But certainty is precisely what governance is for”

**BM:**\
Governance exists to reduce risk. Forecasts, plans, and commitments are how we provide that assurance.

**ESC:**\
In low-uncertainty environments, absolutely.

But in complex product environments, early certainty doesn’t reduce risk — it displaces it. It pushes learning later, when change is more expensive and politically harder.

What looks like reassurance upstream often creates fragility downstream.

***

#### “Are you suggesting we stop planning?”

**BM:**\
Let me be clear — this board will not support a model that replaces planning with improvisation.

**ESC:**\
Nor should it.

What I’m suggesting is a distinction between _what we know_ and _what we assume_ — and governing them differently.

* **Aspirational outcomes** guide direction under uncertainty
* **High-integrity commitments** are made only once learning supports them

At the moment, we treat both as if they were the same — and govern assumptions as though they were facts.

***

#### “That sounds like reduced accountability”

**BM:**\
My concern is accountability. If plans are provisional and funding is adaptive, who is answerable when things don’t work?

**ESC:**\
Accountability actually increases — it just shifts focus.

Instead of asking _“Did you deliver the plan?”_\
we ask _“What did we learn, and how did we act on it?”_

Leaders are held accountable for:

* the assumptions they sponsor
* the evidence they demand
* the signals they respond to
* and how quickly they correct course

This is not less discipline. It’s discipline aligned to uncertainty.

***

#### “What would change at board level?”

**BM:**\
Concretely — how would this change what we do in this room?

**ESC:**\
Three things:

1. **Fewer premature commitments**\
   We would stop asking for confidence before learning exists.
2. **Different signals**\
   Board discussions would centre on evidence, trends, and constraint removal — not delivery narratives.
3. **Adaptive investment**\
   Funding would be staged. Continuation would be justified by learning, not by sunk cost or optimism.

The board still governs — but governs _adaptation_, not compliance.

***

#### “Isn’t this fundamentally riskier?”

**BM:**\
Surface-level honesty usually is. This sounds like it exposes us to more uncomfortable truths.

**ESC:**\
It does — earlier.

The real risk isn’t learning faster.\
The risk is discovering too late that our certainty was misplaced — after reputational, financial, and opportunity costs have accumulated.

This approach doesn’t increase risk. It shortens the time it takes to see it.

***

#### “What role does leadership actually play?”

**BM:**\
Assuming we were open to this, where does responsibility sit?

**ESC:**\
Squarely with leadership.

This only works if we:

* stop rewarding plan defence over learning
* stop penalising course correction
* stop demanding certainty as a condition of trust

Teams already optimise rationally within the system we give them.\
If we want different behaviour, we must change the system that makes current behaviour sensible.

***

#### “And if we choose not to?”

**BM:**\
If we do nothing, what happens?

**ESC:**\
Then the organisation will continue to:

* over-commit early
* manage risk through reporting rather than learning
* optimise locally to survive
* and deliver activity without reliably improving outcomes

And we will keep asking why capable people don’t behave the way we intend.

***

#### Closing Reflection

**BM:**\
You’re not proposing more flexibility. You’re proposing different discipline.

**ESC:**\
Exactly.

Discipline that reflects how uncertainty actually works — not how we wish it did.

This is not about relaxing control.\
It’s about designing a system where better decisions become the default.
