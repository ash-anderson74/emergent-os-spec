# You Don’t Adopt an Operating Model — You Enter It

One of the first questions people are likely to ask when encountering the Emergent Operating Model is:

> _“How do we adopt it?”_\
> &#xNAN;_“Where do we start?”_

The impulse behind the question is understandable. Organisations are accustomed to improvement initiatives that begin with a rollout plan, a target state, or a sequence of steps. Change is framed as movement toward something defined in advance.

EOM refuses that framing — not out of contrarianism, but because it does not survive contact with complexity.

Adaptive operating models are not adopted.\
They are **entered**.

***

### Adoption Assumes Knowing the Destination

Adoption implies a sequence:

1. Understand the model
2. Decide to adopt it
3. Implement it consistently
4. Reach a stable end state

This logic works when:

* the problem is well understood
* the solution is largely known
* cause and effect are predictable
* variation is undesirable

These are not the conditions EOM is designed for.

In complex product environments, the challenge is not insufficient structure.\
It is insufficient **learning before commitment**.

You cannot adopt an operating model whose defining feature is that behaviour must change _in response to evidence_. Any attempt to implement EOM “properly” in advance contradicts the very assumptions it makes.

***

### Entering an Operating Model Is a Shift in Posture

To enter EOM is to change how decisions are made _before_ changing what people do.

It means moving from:

* rollout → diagnosis
* prescription → observation
* certainty → hypothesis
* enforcement → sensing

Nothing is installed.\
Nothing is enforced.

Instead, the organisation begins to operate **as if learning matters** — and observes what that makes possible or difficult.

Understanding follows action, not the reverse.

***

### There Is No Single Starting Point

Organisations do not enter EOM at the same place.

They enter where the system is currently weakest — where learning is slow, risky, or actively suppressed.

In practice, entry points tend to cluster around a small number of system tensions.

***

#### Entry Through Commitment

Some organisations begin here because:

* plans harden early
* changing direction is politically expensive
* escalation replaces exploration

In these environments, entry begins by questioning **when certainty is actually required**.

Rather than redefining delivery practices, leaders experiment with:

* smaller funding tranches
* explicit treatment of work as hypothesis
* reversible commitments where uncertainty is high

The first change is not what teams deliver.\
It is what leaders **demand certainty about**.

***

#### Entry Through Flow

Others enter through frustration with congestion and delay.

Everything appears prioritised.\
Everything is in progress.\
Very little finishes cleanly.

Here, entry does not begin with acceleration.

It begins with visibility:

* exposing queues
* constraining work in progress
* treating delay as diagnostic data

The organisation does not optimise flow.\
It learns where flow is being constrained — and why.

***

#### Entry Through Measurement

Some organisations enter through discomfort with metrics.

Dashboards look healthy.\
Surprises still arrive late.\
Bad news travels slowly.

Here, entry begins by separating **learning from judgement**:

* treating metrics as signals, not targets
* reviewing trends instead of point values
* legitimising anomalies as inquiry, not failure

Measurement stops being a shield.\
It becomes information again.

***

### What These Entry Points Have in Common

These are not “implementation steps”.

They share three essential properties:

1. **They introduce constraints, not practices**
2. **They generate feedback before enforcing behaviour**
3. **They can be reversed if they do not produce learning**

Any change that cannot be reversed under uncertainty is already incompatible with EOM.

This is the test.

***

### Why “Just Start Where You Are” Is Not a Cop-Out

Peter Senge famously described learning organisations as something you _walk into by walking_ — “beating the path as you walk along it”.

EOM makes the same claim, but adds discipline.

You do not start anywhere.\
You start where your system currently **prevents learning**.

The act of starting is itself diagnostic.

Missteps are not failures of adoption.\
They are information about the constraints you haven’t seen yet.

***

### What EOM Deliberately Refuses to Provide

EOM does not offer:

* an adoption roadmap
* readiness criteria
* maturity stages
* required first steps
* canonical sequences

Providing these would collapse the model into the very class of frameworks it exists to explain — and often to escape.

The absence of a rollout plan is not an omission.\
It is a boundary.

***

### How You Know You’ve Entered EOM

An organisation has entered EOM when:

* decisions become easier to change than to defend
* learning travels faster than plans
* stopping work early is treated as competence
* governance notices patterns instead of enforcing compliance
* behaviour shifts without new rules being introduced

These are not outcomes to chase.\
They are **signals** that the operating environment has changed.

***

### In Closing

You do not adopt an operating model designed for emergence.

You enter it by changing one system constraint that currently makes learning difficult — and then watching carefully.

Clarity follows contact.\
Understanding follows movement.\
Coherence follows learning.

That is not avoidance of responsibility.

It is what responsibility looks like under uncertainty.
