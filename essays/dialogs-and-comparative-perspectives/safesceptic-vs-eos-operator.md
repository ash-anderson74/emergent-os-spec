# A Conversation Between a SAFe Practitioner and an EOM Operator

## A Conversation Between a SAFe Practitioner and an EOM Operator

This essay presents a structured conversation between two experienced practitioners.

One is a seasoned SAFe practitioner, sceptical of yet another “alternative” operating model.\
The other operates within the **Emergent Operating Model (EOM)** and has lived through multiple large-scale transformations.

The goal is not to win an argument, but to surface assumptions that are often left implicit.

***

### “Why do we need another operating model?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
We already have a scaled framework. It gives us alignment, planning cadence, roles, and governance. Why do we need something else?

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM isn’t trying to replace anything you’re using.

It exists because many organisations _already have_ frameworks, roles, and cadences — and still struggle to change outcomes. EOM isn’t a framework; it’s a way to explain **why those things behave the way they do once they meet a real organisation**.

The question EOM starts with isn’t “what should we roll out?”, but “what does our system currently optimise for — and why?”

### “But without structure, isn’t this just chaos?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
Frameworks exist to create structure. Without explicit roles, events, and artefacts, things fall apart.

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM doesn’t reject structure. It rejects the assumption that _imposed structure reliably produces learning in complex systems_.

EOM assumes structure already exists — in incentives, funding models, governance, decision rights, and risk distribution. These often matter more than ceremonies.

When behaviour doesn’t change, EOM asks:

* What is rewarded?
* Where does risk sit?
* How fast does feedback arrive?
* What happens when someone is wrong?

Structure is already shaping behaviour. EOM makes that structure visible.

### “Surely planning increments are essential at scale?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
At enterprise scale, you need predictability. Planning increments align teams and manage dependencies.

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM doesn’t argue against alignment. It questions whether **predictive coordination is the right mechanism** in environments with high uncertainty.

At scale, planning often becomes a substitute for learning. Dependencies are managed on paper instead of reduced in reality. Risk is back-loaded. Feedback arrives after commitment.

EOM replaces “align on plans” with:

* align on outcomes
* constrain work in progress
* validate learning before commitment
* adapt funding and scope based on evidence

The aim isn’t less coordination. It’s _less brittle coordination_.

***

### “How do you govern without commitments?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
Leadership needs commitments. Regulators, customers, and boards expect certainty.

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM doesn’t eliminate commitments. It makes them **explicit and rare**.

Most work operates under uncertainty and benefits from aspirational outcomes and experimentation. Some work genuinely requires guarantees.

EOM distinguishes clearly between:

* **Aspirational outcomes** (treated as hypotheses)
* **High-integrity commitments** (made only after learning has reduced risk)

The problem EOM addresses is not commitment — it’s pretending certainty exists when it doesn’t.

***

### “This sounds like teams doing whatever they want.”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
Decentralisation sounds attractive, but without strong governance, teams optimise locally and the organisation fragments.

**EOM Operator:**\
Local optimisation already happens — usually because global intent is weak, delayed, or abstract.

EOM doesn’t decentralise intent. It decentralises **decision-making within clear boundaries**:

* strategy is explicit
* outcomes are visible
* flow is constrained
* learning is reviewed
* funding adapts

Teams are autonomous _in service of shared outcomes_, not independent actors.

When local optimisation harms the system, EOM treats it as a **design problem**, not a performance problem.

***

### “Where are the best practices?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
Frameworks are valuable because they tell people what good looks like.

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM is deliberately cautious about prescribing practices.

The same practices appear again and again across Lean, DevOps, product discovery, and systems thinking — but they only work when the surrounding conditions support them.

EOM focuses on those conditions:

* incentives
* constraints
* feedback loops
* governance mechanisms

Practices emerge from context. EOM helps you understand _why_ one practice works in one organisation and fails in another.

***

### “How do you know EOM works?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
Frameworks at least come with case studies and certifications. How do you validate EOM?

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM doesn’t claim to “work” in the way a product does.

It reflects patterns that already exist whenever organisations:

* reduce time to learning
* align around outcomes
* decentralise decision-making responsibly
* improve flow at scale

If EOM resonates, it’s because people recognise their own experience in it.

If it doesn’t, it’s probably because the organisation is operating in a more deterministic domain — and EOM explicitly says not to use it there.

***

### “So what problem is EOM actually solving?”

**SAFe Practitioner:**\
If you had to summarise it, what’s the real problem EOM addresses?

**EOM Operator:**\
EOM exists to explain why **reasonable people make decisions that produce unreasonable system-level outcomes**.

And to show that changing behaviour rarely works unless the operating environment changes first.

It’s not an alternative to frameworks.

It’s a lens for understanding why frameworks succeed, fail, or decay — and what needs to change when they do.

***

### Closing Reflection

This conversation isn’t about right versus wrong.

It reflects two different starting assumptions:

* One assumes alignment comes from planning and orchestration.
* The other assumes alignment emerges from shared outcomes, fast feedback, and system-level learning.

The Emergent Operating Model does not ask organisations to abandon what they know.

It asks them to stop mistaking structure for understanding — and to design systems where learning, not prediction, governs behaviour.
