# What Does “Operating Model” Mean in Emergent Operating Model?

The term _operating model_ is widely used — and widely misunderstood.

In most organisations, an operating model implies:

* a target state
* a structural blueprint
* defined roles and responsibilities
* standardised processes
* prescribed ways of working

Emergent Operating Model (EOM) deliberately does **not** use the term in this way.

This essay exists to clarify what _operating model_ means in EOM — and just as importantly, what it does **not** mean.

***

### Not a Blueprint, Target State, or Rollout Plan

Emergent Operating Model is **not**:

* an organisational design
* a delivery framework
* a process architecture
* a maturity model
* a transformation end-state
* something to “implement” or “roll out”

Nothing is installed.\
Nothing is mandated.\
Nothing executes automatically.

If you are looking for a defined future state to migrate toward, EOM is the wrong abstraction.

***

### Why Use the Term “Operating Model” at all?

The term is used because it names something most approaches leave implicit.

EOM is concerned with **how an organisation actually operates under uncertainty**, not how it claims to operate.

Specifically, EOM makes explicit:

* the assumptions an organisation makes about uncertainty
* how decisions are shaped by incentives, risk, and authority
* how learning influences — or fails to influence — investment
* how flow, feedback, and governance interact
* what must remain true for adaptability to persist

These are not processes.

They are **operating conditions**.

### Operating Model as a System of Constraints

In Emergent Operating Model, _operating model_ means:

> **A coherent set of constraints and invariants that shape behaviour without prescribing practice.**

Constraints do not dictate action. They determine what actions are _rational_.

Within EOM:

* behaviour is shaped by what is safe, rewarded, and permitted
* decisions emerge from incentives, feedback loops, and authority boundaries
* patterns repeat because the system makes them sensible

EOM does not tell teams _what_ to do. It defines the conditions under which certain behaviours become inevitable.

***

### A Useful Analogy (With Care)

A computer operating system is sometimes used as an analogy — not because EOM resembles software, but because it illustrates how constraints work.

An operating system:

* does not tell applications what problems to solve
* does not dictate behaviour
* provides boundaries, interfaces, and safety guarantees

Applications differ wildly — but all operate within the same constraints.

EOM works similarly.

It does not mandate:

* specific practices
* delivery methods
* tools or ceremonies
* organisational structures

Instead, it defines:

* how commitments are made responsibly
* how learning is legitimised
* how flow is observed
* how authority aligns with evidence
* how governance guides without controlling

Practices operate _within_ these boundaries.

***

### Why This Is Not a Framework

Frameworks typically imply:

* adoption
* standardisation
* prescribed components
* progress through maturity levels

Emergent Operating Model explicitly rejects these expectations.

EOM constrains **behavioural possibilities**, not implementations. It preserves choice while shaping outcomes.

This is why EOM resists the question:

> “Where do we start?”

And instead asks:

> **“What assumptions, constraints, and incentives are currently shaping behaviour — and are they fit for uncertainty?”**

***

### What EOM Actually Operates

Emergent Operating Model operates at the level of:

* decision-making
* prioritisation
* investment logic
* learning loops
* governance behaviour
* accountability placement
* coordination across teams and domains

It influences _how_ decisions are made, _when_ confidence is justified, and _why_ behaviour repeats — without specifying _what_ work must be done.

This is why EOM applies beyond product and engineering. Finance, leadership, governance, and strategy all operate within the same constraint system.

***

### Why This Distinction Matters

Misunderstanding EOM as a blueprint leads to predictable failure modes:

* treating it as something to implement
* asking for prescribed practices
* adopting tools without changing incentives
* measuring success through compliance
* adding structure without altering constraints

Clarifying what _operating model_ means here is not semantic. It protects EOM from becoming the very thing it was designed to resist.

***

### In Summary

Emergent Operating Model defines **how an organisation operates when outcomes cannot be predicted upfront**.

It does not command behaviour. It shapes what behaviour makes sense.

It provides constraints, not instructions.\
It enables coordination, not control.\
It legitimises learning, not prediction.

Nothing is installed.\
Nothing is enforced.

Everything operates _within_ it.

That is what _operating model_ means in Emergent Operating Model.
