# A Plain-English Introduction to Systems Thinking

Much of the frustration people experience in organisations comes from a simple mismatch:

* we explain problems in terms of **people**
* but the problems are usually caused by **systems**

Systems thinking is the discipline of recognising that difference.

This essay introduces the idea in practical terms, without theory or jargon, and explains why the **Emergent Operating Model (EOM)** depends on it.

***

### Why Individual Explanations Fall Short

When something goes wrong in an organisation, the usual explanations sound familiar:

* teams didn’t follow the process
* people resisted change
* leaders didn’t communicate clearly
* individuals made poor decisions

Sometimes these explanations contain truth.\
They are rarely sufficient.

If capable people repeatedly make the same “bad” decisions, it is unlikely they have suddenly become irrational. More often, they are responding sensibly to the environment around them.

Systems thinking starts from a simple assumption:

> **If behaviour is persistent, it is probably being rewarded — or at least made rational — by the system.**

***

### What Is a “System” in This Context?

In organisational terms, a system is not software or an org chart.

It is the combination of:

* how decisions are actually made
* who carries risk
* what is rewarded or punished
* how work flows
* what information is visible or hidden
* how feedback arrives — and how fast

Most of this is invisible in day-to-day work.\
Yet it shapes behaviour more powerfully than policies, values statements, or intent.

You can think of it as the organisation’s **default settings**.

***

### Why Behaviour Makes Sense Locally

Systems thinking asks a deceptively simple question:

> **“What would make this behaviour the sensible choice?”**

For example:

* Why do teams pad estimates?\
  → Because being wrong is punished more than being slow.
* Why do status reports sound optimistic?\
  → Because bad news creates personal risk.
* Why do people avoid experimentation?\
  → Because failure carries cost, but learning does not carry protection.

From inside the system, these are not failures of character.\
They are rational responses to the conditions people operate within.

***

### Local Optimisation vs System Outcomes

One of the most important ideas in systems thinking is this:

> **Local optimisation can be rational — and still damage the system as a whole.**

Each team may do the sensible thing to protect itself:

* minimise risk
* meet commitments
* defend plans
* avoid blame

Yet collectively, these behaviours can:

* slow learning
* increase delays
* accumulate hidden risk
* reduce adaptability

This is not because teams are misaligned.\
It is because the system rewards the _wrong kind_ of alignment.

***

### Why Telling People to “Behave Differently” Rarely Works

When organisations try to change behaviour directly, they often:

* introduce new frameworks
* define better values
* run training programmes
* exhort leaders to “model the right mindset”

These efforts fail when the underlying system remains unchanged.

People quickly learn what _actually_ matters:

* which metrics affect their standing
* which risks are tolerated
* which outcomes trigger intervention

Behaviour follows incentives and constraints — not slogans.

Systems thinking therefore flips the change question:

> Instead of asking _“How do we get people to behave differently?”_\
> ask _“What would need to change for different behaviour to make sense?”_

***

### Where Emergent Operating Model Fits

The **Emergent Operating Model (EOM)** is built explicitly on systems thinking.

It is anchored in a simple premise:

> **People behave rationally within the constraints of the operating model they inhabit.**

EOM does not try to impose better behaviour.\
It focuses on changing the conditions that make certain behaviours inevitable.

By emphasising:

* learning before commitment
* flow as a system signal, not a target
* governance as sensing rather than control
* constraints rather than instructions

EOM reshapes the environment in which decisions are made.

When the system changes, behaviour follows — without enforcement.

***

### A Different Way to Think About Change

Systems thinking does not remove accountability.\
It reframes it.

Instead of blaming individuals for outcomes they cannot control, it holds organisations accountable for the systems they design and tolerate.

This leads to a different kind of change:

Less:

* directive-driven behaviour change
* rollouts and mandates
* repeated “transformations”

More:

* deliberate constraint design
* faster learning
* healthier trade-offs
* behaviours that align naturally with intent

***

### In Closing

Systems thinking is not abstract theory.

It is simply the recognition that:

> **Behaviour is shaped more by context than character.**

The Emergent Operating Model exists because most organisational change efforts stop at behaviour — and never touch the system that makes that behaviour rational.

Once you see that distinction, you cannot unsee it.

And once you design for it, change stops being something you _push_ — and starts being something the system _permits_.
