# One Operating System, Many Experiences

When people talk about “the organisational operating system,” it is easy to assume there is a single, uniform thing that everyone experiences in the same way.

In practice, that is almost never true.

Although an organisation may define a single strategy, governance model, or way of working, that operating system is **rendered locally**. Teams do not experience the system directly; they experience it through the constraints that surround their work.

Those constraints are not evenly distributed.

They include:

* where decisions can be made
* who absorbs risk when things go wrong
* how visible uncertainty is
* how tightly work is monitored
* how many dependencies a team must coordinate
* what happens when plans are challenged
* which signals are rewarded or punished

As a result, teams within the same organisation often inhabit **materially different versions of the operating system**, even when the formal model is identical.

This explains a common and confusing pattern:

* one team feels safe to speak up, experiment, and adapt
* another team, equally capable, becomes cautious, defensive, or silent

The difference is not attitude, maturity, or talent.

It is the **local operating conditions**.

From an Emergent Operating Model (EOM) perspective, behaviour is not a personal trait.\
It is a rational response to the system as experienced locally.

When a team learns that surfacing uncertainty invites scrutiny, escalation, or reputational risk, silence becomes sensible.\
When a team learns that early learning is welcomed and protected, candour becomes rational.

Psychological safety, learning, and adaptability therefore vary not because the organisation is inconsistent, but because **the system is inconsistently experienced**.

This distinction matters.

Without it, differences between teams are often attributed to:

* “good” or “bad” leadership
* cultural fit
* individual capability
* team maturity

These explanations obscure the real question:

> What local constraints make certain behaviours rational here — and risky elsewhere?

EOM makes this question explicit. It treats variation in behaviour as a signal of variation in system design, not a failure of people.

The operating system may be global in intent, but it is always local in practice.

Understanding that is a prerequisite for any organisation that wants change to persist without constant enforcement.

### Implications for Leaders

For leaders, this means that improving behaviour across the organisation is not primarily a matter of messaging, training, or exhortation. It requires examining how authority, risk, feedback, and visibility are distributed locally. When teams behave differently under the same formal model, the question is not “why aren’t they aligned?” but “what conditions are they responding to?” Sustainable change emerges when leaders focus less on enforcing consistency and more on redesigning the local operating conditions that make learning, candour, and adaptation rational everywhere—not just in pockets where the system happens to be safer.

This perspective is explored further in the essay **“**[**Why Psychological Safety Emerges — or Disappears — by Design**](why-psychological-safety-emerges-or-disappears-by-design.md)**”**, which examines how safety emerges from operating conditions rather than individual disposition.
