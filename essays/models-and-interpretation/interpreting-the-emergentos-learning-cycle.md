# Interpreting the Emergent Operating Model Learning Cycle

The Emergent Operating Model (EOM) learning cycle illustrates how delivery, discovery, and improvement operate together within a complex, changing context. It is not a process, a workflow, or a delivery cadence. It is a **conceptual model** that explains how learning governs the system over time.

The diagram should be read **from the outside inward**, with particular attention to the relationships between layers rather than the sequence of activity.

#### Context as a Continuous Constraint

The outermost ring represents **context**.

The Emergent Operating Model (EOM) assumes that organisations operate within an environment that is never neutral or static. Market conditions, regulation, technology, organisational history, and human dynamics continuously exert pressure on the system. Context does not appear only at planning points; it is always present and always shaping outcomes.

This reinforces a core assumption of EOM: **certainty cannot be assumed**, and planning must remain responsive to changing conditions rather than attempting to eliminate them.

#### Continuous Discovery and Continuous Improvement

Within that context sit two interwoven learning loops:

* **Continuous Discovery**, focused on understanding customer problems, validating assumptions, and learning what outcomes are worth pursuing.
* **Continuous Improvement**, focused on improving how the system delivers value safely, sustainably, and predictably.

These activities occur concurrently. Discovery does not “finish” before delivery begins, and improvement does not wait until work is complete. Both are ongoing forms of learning that shape decisions throughout the cycle.

***

#### Slowification: Deliberate Pauses for Learning

The highlighted wedge represents **Slowification**.

Slowification is the deliberate act of slowing decision-making at specific moments in order to improve learning quality. In EOM, this occurs explicitly during:

* **Weeks 1–2**, where teams and leaders focus on framing problems, practising discovery, and clarifying intent.
* **Week 12**, where reflection, validation, and systemic learning occur.

Slowification does not mean slowing delivery. Work continues to flow. Instead, it reduces the cost of rework, misalignment, and premature commitment by concentrating thoughtful sense-making into protected time.

#### Delivery as a Continuous Activity

The inner ring represents **delivery**.

Delivery is continuous, iterative, and always in motion. It encompasses building, testing, releasing, and operating value. The small markers along the ring indicate incremental progress, feedback points, and learning signals rather than predefined milestones.

Delivery is not the centre of the system. It is intentionally positioned within broader learning loops, emphasising that execution serves learning and outcomes—not the other way around.

***

#### Humans at the Centre

At the centre of the model is the **human**.

The Emergent Operating Model is a **socio-technical operating model**.\
Decisions, trade-offs, and interpretation ultimately rest with people, not processes or tools.\
Information, feedback, and signals flow through the model to support human sense-making and judgement.

The model exists to enable people to make better decisions under uncertainty—not to remove the need for thinking.

***

#### How the Cycle Works Over Time

Although the diagram is circular, it encodes time through repetition rather than linear progression.

The learning cycle repeats on a **quarterly cadence**, but learning accumulates rather than resetting. Insights gained through discovery, delivery, and improvement inform future intent, strategy, and operating decisions.

There is no terminal state. EOM assumes that adaptation is continuous and that improvement emerges through sustained learning rather than one-off transformation efforts.

***

#### What This Diagram Is — and Is Not

This model is intended to help organisations:

* understand how learning governs flow
* legitimise deliberate pauses for reflection
* see delivery as part of a larger adaptive system
* recognise context as a first-class constraint

It should not be interpreted as:

* a delivery framework
* a planning process
* an implementation guide
* a sequence of steps to follow

If the question being asked is _“Where do we start?”_, the diagram has been misread.

#### Summary

The Emergent Operating Model learning cycle shows a system that is always delivering, always discovering, and always improving—while deliberately slowing down at key moments to learn.

It depicts **how learning shapes behaviour over time**, rather than how work should be scheduled or controlled. In EOM, sustainable outcomes emerge when flow is protected, learning is prioritised, and people are supported to make sense of a changing world.
