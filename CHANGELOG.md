# Changelog

All notable changes to EmergentOS are documented in this file.

EmergentOS is a living specification. Changes reflect learning, clarification, and evolution rather than “feature delivery”.

## [v1.0] — Frozen EmergentOS v1

### Status

EmergentOS v1 is now **frozen**.

This release represents a complete, coherent operating system for adaptability in complex socio-technical environments. Further evolution is governed by the EmergentOS Evolution Policy.

### Added

- Formal **EmergentOS v1 freeze** and governance/evolution policy
- Explicit constraints defining what must remain true for EmergentOS to function
- Completed **Specification** with:
  - Values and principles
  - Core domains
  - Operating cadence
  - Flow and learning model
  - Governance and funding model
  - Roles and accountabilities
  - Adoption and evolution guidance
  - Explicit “when not to use EmergentOS”
- Fully articulated **Quarterly Learning Cycle**, integrating:
  - Strategy and alignment
  - Discovery and delivery
  - Validation and reflection
  - Slowification as a deliberate systemic practice
- Completed **Field Guide**, including:
  - Outcome-oriented strategy
  - Funding as a learning system
  - Flow as a diagnostic, not a target
  - Team autonomy and interaction boundaries
  - Improvement as deliberate system work
  - Aspirational outcomes vs high-integrity commitments
- EOS-aligned **Practice Playbooks** with concrete, non-prescriptive guidance:
  - OKRs in EmergentOS
  - Continuous discovery
  - Lean Kata for system-level improvement
  - Flow metrics as diagnostic instruments
  - Adaptive funding and metered investment
  - Strategic alignment using Lean Value Trees, OKRs, and Portfolio Kanban
  - The EmergentOS Quarterly Learning Cycle
- Complete **Patterns Library (v1)** describing recurring system conditions
- Complete **Anti-Patterns Library (v1)** documenting common failure modes and distortions
- Sense-making **Essays**, including:
  - How EmergentOS Avoids the Illusion of Alignment
  - Why Team Structure Emerges from Constraints
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key design choices, including:
  - Outcome-based planning over output-based planning
  - Rejection of deterministic planning by default
  - Adaptive funding over deterministic budgeting
  - Treating flow metrics as signals, not targets
- Added explanatory essays to disambiguate the term “operating system” in an organisational context
- Introduced the EmergentOS component relationship model as an interpretive aid
- Added narrative guidance on how to read conceptual diagrams without treating them as implementation artefacts
- Improved cross-space navigation and reader orientation across Spec, Field Guide, Essays, and Patterns
- Added anchor as clarification

### Notes

This release reflects a synthesis of repeated patterns observed across Lean, DevOps, product discovery, and organizational design literature.

EmergentOS v1 intentionally resists:

- prescriptive practices
- maturity models
- certification schemes
- deterministic scaling frameworks
- compliance-driven transformation models

Its value lies in **coherence, restraint, and clarity**, not completeness.

## [v0.1] — Initial Public Specification (Archived)

### Added

- Core EmergentOS intent, scope, and positioning
- Explicit rejection of deterministic planning as a default
- Outcome-driven planning principles (Lean Value Trees, OKRs)
- Modular operating system framing
- Initial articulation of core domains
- Early quarterly cadence with embedded slowification
- Coaching-led governance concepts
- Adaptive funding and portfolio flow ideas
- Alignment with DevOps (Three Ways) and Lean principles
- Initial role patterns
- Early non-goals and anti-patterns

### Notes

This version served as an exploratory synthesis intended to invite critique, learning, and refinement. It has been superseded by the frozen v1 release.

## Versioning Guidelines

- **Major versions (v1.0, v2.0):**  
  Conceptual or structural shifts that materially change the operating system

- **Minor versions (v1.x):**  
  Clarifications, refinements, or corrections that preserve core intent

- **Patch versions (v1.x.y):**  
  Editorial changes, navigation improvements, or reference updates only

---

## Upcoming

EmergentOS v1 is frozen.

Future exploration may occur outside the specification and inform potential v2 directions, but no commitments are made at this time.
