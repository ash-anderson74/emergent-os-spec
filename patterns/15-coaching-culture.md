# Pattern: Coaching Culture

## Context

Your organization aspires to become more adaptive and outcome-driven but still relies on traditional management practices. Leaders often focus on tasks, deadlines, and reporting, which limits team autonomy and learning. Teams need guidance and support to grow, improve, and feel safe to experiment.

## Problem

Without a coaching mindset, leaders inadvertently stifle innovation and adaptability. Teams become compliance-driven, not outcome-driven. Continuous improvement feels optional instead of embedded.

## Forces

* Leaders feel pressure to provide predictability and maintain confidence across the organization.
* Teams seek guidance and clarity but want to avoid micromanagement.
* Existing cultural norms often emphasize authority and control over empowerment and autonomy.
* Coaching capabilities are not yet widespread and require intentional development and support.

## Solution

Shift leadership from directing to coaching. Equip managers with playbooks and rituals that foster clarity, competence, and autonomy. Embed coaching into governance through OKR reviews, flow metrics discussions, and retrospectives. Leaders ask enabling questions like:

* “What’s blocking flow?”
* “Where do you need time to learn or improve?”
* “How can I help remove obstacles?”

Use **Intent-Based Leadership** principles: give control, increase competence, and ensure clarity. Make coaching a visible, measurable part of leadership responsibilities.

## Result

Teams feel trusted and supported. Leaders guide through data and dialogue, not directives. Continuous improvement becomes systemic. Psychological safety grows, enabling experimentation and learning. The organization evolves faster and more sustainably.
