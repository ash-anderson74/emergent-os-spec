# Team Topologies and Interaction Boundaries

## Context

As organizations scale, coordination costs increase.

Poorly defined team responsibilities and interactions lead to friction, delays, and cognitive overload.

## Problem

Without clear team boundaries:

- dependencies multiply
- ownership becomes unclear
- context switching increases
- teams lose autonomy
- delivery slows

Reorganizing repeatedly does not solve the underlying problem.

## Forces

- Pressure to “add coordination”
- Legacy reporting structures
- Tooling over architecture
- People assigned to multiple teams
- Work flowing across unclear boundaries

## Solution

Design teams intentionally around:

- value streams
- bounded cognitive load
- explicit interaction modes

Clarify:

- who owns what
- how teams collaborate
- when dependencies are acceptable

Structure supports flow rather than obstructing it.

## Result

- Teams operate with clearer purpose
- Cognitive load decreases
- Dependencies become visible and manageable
- Autonomy is sustained at scale

## Trade-offs

- Requires investment in org design
- Some flexibility is intentionally constrained
- Not all dependencies can be removed

- Visualize Work
- Flow First
