# Pattern: Flow First

## Context

Your organization struggles with delays, bottlenecks, and unpredictable delivery. Teams are busy, but work piles up in queues, dependencies stall progress, and leadership focuses on deadlines rather than throughput.

## Problem

Traditional planning emphasizes scope and dates, not flow. Work starts before teams have capacity, creating overload and context switching. Bottlenecks remain hidden, and improvement is reactive rather than systemic.

## Forces

* Stakeholders want visibility and predictability.
* Teams feel pressure to start more work to “look busy.”
* Dependencies and handoffs slow progress.
* Metrics often measure output, not flow health.

## Solution

Make **flow the primary lens for planning and governance**. Visualize work using **Kanban** at team and portfolio levels. Apply **WIP limits** to prevent overload. Use **flow metrics** (cycle time, throughput, aging work) and **DORA indicators** to guide decisions. Embed **Lean Kata** and **Flow Engineering** to continuously improve delivery systems. Coach leaders to manage through flow—not control through timelines.

## Result

Work moves predictably and smoothly. Bottlenecks are surfaced and addressed early. Teams deliver iteratively without burnout. Leadership gains real-time insight into delivery health and focuses on enabling flow rather than enforcing deadlines.
