# Pattern: Behaviour to Constraint Mapping

## Pattern Type

**Diagnostic Pattern**

## Intent

To identify which system constraints make an undesirable behaviour rational, in order to change the system rather than attempting to change people.

***

## Context

An organisation observes a recurring behaviour that is widely regarded as undesirable, ineffective, or misaligned with stated intent.

Examples include:

* deterministic planning in high-uncertainty contexts
* excessive estimation and forecasting
* defensive status reporting
* risk avoidance and slow decision-making
* local optimisation that degrades system outcomes

Despite repeated attempts to correct the behaviour through guidance, training, or expectation-setting, the behaviour persists.

***

## Problem

The organisation treats behaviour as the problem.

As a result:

* people are coached, encouraged, or pressured to “behave differently”
* new practices are introduced alongside existing incentives
* compliance is monitored rather than constraints examined
* frustration increases on all sides

The behaviour remains rational within the system, so it does not change.

***

## Forces at Play

* People optimise for safety, credibility, and survival within the system
* The system rewards predictability, narrative coherence, or risk deflection
* Learning is treated as secondary to commitment
* Uncertainty is implicitly punished
* Governance relies on forward certainty rather than evidence

These forces make the behaviour the least risky option available.

***

## Solution

Apply **Behaviour → Constraint Mapping**.

Instead of asking _why people behave this way_, the organisation systematically asks:

> **What constraints make this behaviour the safest, most rewarded, or least risky choice?**

This is typically done using a reframed causal inquiry (often adapted from techniques such as _5 Whys_), with one critical rule:

* **Answers must reference system conditions, not people.**

***

## Structure

### Step 1: Name the Behaviour Neutrally

Describe the behaviour without judgement.

Example:

> “Teams perform detailed estimation and create sequenced delivery plans before learning has occurred.”

***

### Step 2: Ask Constraint-Focused “Why” Questions

Iteratively ask _why this behaviour is rational_, ensuring responses surface:

* incentives
* governance expectations
* risk distribution
* approval mechanisms
* information latency
* legitimacy signals

Example progression:

* Why do teams estimate in detail?
* Why is certainty expected at that point?
* Why is learning not accepted as input?
* Why is credibility equated with prediction?
* What happens if uncertainty is exposed?

Stop when answers clearly point to **structural conditions**, not authority or intent.

***

### Step 3: Identify Constraint Classes

Common constraint categories include:

* funding and investment rules
* governance and review forums
* performance evaluation mechanisms
* reporting and visibility expectations
* dependency and coordination structures
* timing of commitment relative to learning

The goal is not exhaustiveness, but sufficiency.

***

### Step 4: Reframe the Behaviour

Replace the original framing (“undesirable behaviour”) with:

> **“This behaviour is a rational response to these constraints.”**

This reframing is essential. It shifts accountability from individuals to system design.

***

### Step 5: Select a Constraint to Adjust

Do **not** attempt to address all constraints.

Instead, ask:

* Which constraint most strongly reinforces the behaviour?
* Which one could be adjusted with minimal disruption?
* What small change would make the behaviour unnecessary?

Interventions target **constraints**, not behaviour.

***

## Resulting Context

When constraints change:

* new behaviours emerge without instruction
* old behaviours atrophy naturally
* resistance decreases
* learning becomes safer
* governance conversations shift from blame to design

The system evolves without enforcement.

***

## Anti-Patterns

* Stopping at “because leadership wants it”
* Concluding with “culture” or “mindset”
* Treating the final answer as a root cause to fix
* Responding with training or communication plans
* Measuring success by behaviour compliance rather than system signals

These approaches violate the EOS anchor.

***

## EOM Alignment

This pattern directly enacts the core EOM principle:

> **To change behaviour, you must change the system that makes that behaviour rational.**

It assumes:

* behaviour is information
* persistence signals protection
* fear and optimisation are rational
* learning requires structural permission

***

## Known Uses

This pattern is commonly applied to:

* planning and estimation practices
* status reporting and governance forums
* risk escalation behaviours
* backlog and prioritisation conflicts
* improvement work starvation
* defensive metric usage

***

## Closing Note

Behaviour → Constraint Mapping does not tell organisations what to do.

It makes visible **what the system is already doing**.

Once that is understood, change becomes possible — and often inevitable.
