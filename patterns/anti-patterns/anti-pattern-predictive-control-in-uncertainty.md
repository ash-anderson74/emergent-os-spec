# Anti-Pattern: Predictive Control in Uncertainty

#### Description

The organization applies deterministic planning and commitment models to inherently uncertain work.

#### Why It Emerges

* Control feels responsible
* Commitments reassure stakeholders
* Learning is perceived as risk

#### Consequences

* Assumptions go untested
* Risk is deferred
* Change becomes political
* Plans fail loudly and late

#### Signal

> “The plan was solid — reality just didn’t cooperate.”
