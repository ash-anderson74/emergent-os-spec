# Anti-Pattern: Product as Project Manager

#### Description

Product leaders manage tasks, timelines, and dependencies instead of outcomes and value.

#### Why It Emerges

* Pressure for certainty
* Blurred accountability
* Lack of flow ownership

#### Consequences

* Teams lose autonomy
* Product focus degrades
* Leaders become bottlenecks

#### Signal

> “Product owns the roadmap, delivery, and dependencies.”
