# Anti-Pattern: Budget as Constraint on Learning

#### Description

Funding decisions are locked early and treated as commitments rather than hypotheses.

#### Why It Emerges

* Annual budgeting cycles dominate
* Finance equates predictability with discipline
* Stopping work is socially punished

#### Consequences

* Sunk-cost thinking
* Over-investment in low-value work
* Under-investment in discovery
* Inability to pivot safely

#### Signal

> “We know it’s not working, but we’re already funded.”
