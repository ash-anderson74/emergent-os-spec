# Adaptive Funding Over Deterministic Budgeting

## Context

Traditional budgeting assumes that scope, effort, and value can be forecast accurately in advance.

This assumption rarely holds in environments with high uncertainty, rapid change, or innovation-driven work.

## Problem

Deterministic budgets lock organizations into decisions made with insufficient information.

Consequences include:

- sunk-cost fallacies
- over-investment in low-value work
- under-investment in learning
- inability to stop or pivot safely

Funding becomes a constraint on adaptation.

## Forces

- Finance systems prioritize predictability
- Leaders seek accountability
- Annual cycles reinforce early commitment
- Learning happens after money is spent
- Stopping work carries social and political cost

## Solution

Fund work as a **series of learning bets**, not fixed projects.

Allocate investment incrementally, based on:

- hypotheses about value
- evidence from discovery and delivery
- reduction of uncertainty over time

Funding increases as confidence increases.

## Result

- Financial risk is reduced
- Learning is treated as legitimate work
- Investment follows evidence, not optimism
- Stopping low-signal work becomes acceptable

## Trade-offs

- Requires changes to governance expectations
- Forecasting becomes probabilistic, not exact
- Demands trust and transparency

## Notes

Adaptive funding does not remove fiscal discipline.  
It replaces predictive certainty with empirical confidence.
