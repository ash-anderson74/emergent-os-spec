# Patterns

This directory contains a collection of **reusable patterns** observed across high-performing product and technology organizations.

The patterns are **not Emergent Operating Model-specific requirements**.\
They are transferable abstractions that appear repeatedly across the literature and in practice.

***

## Purpose of the Patterns Library

Patterns exist to:

* capture proven ways of thinking and working
* distill recurring solutions to common problems
* provide building blocks for adaptation
* support sensemaking without prescribing implementation

They describe **what tends to work**, not what must be followed.

> These patterns are used by the Emergent Operating Model but are not specific to it. They can be applied independently.
>
> How EOM uses patterns → [Field Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/GRX8PFtV7EU1EpAUbqjk/s/wVqEs2cuXgPu222Kt8eP/)

## How Patterns Relate to the Emergent Operating Model

The Emergent Operating Model (EOM) is a **coherent composition of these patterns** bound together by explicit principles and constraints.

Patterns:

* can be applied independently of EOM
* may be adopted partially or in isolation
* often appear in multiple contexts and frameworks
* are intentionally implementation-agnostic

EOM:

* selects, constrains, and composes these patterns
* defines the conditions under which they coexist safely
* protects them from misuse through governance and learning

The patterns are the **raw material** from which EOM is formed.

## What a Pattern Is (and Is Not)

A pattern:

* names a recurring problem
* describes forces and tensions
* captures an effective response
* remains adaptable across contexts

A pattern is **not**:

* a practice checklist
* a process step
* a role definition
* a mandate
* a maturity model

Patterns require judgment to apply well.

***

## How to Use This Library

You may use the patterns in this library to:

* inspire change in part of a system
* explain why certain approaches work or fail
* support coaching conversations
* identify missing or conflicting forces
* recombine ideas outside of EOM

You do not need to adopt EOM to benefit from these patterns.

## Patterns, Practices, and Playbooks

Patterns occupy a different level of abstraction from practices.

* **Patterns** describe _what tends to be effective_ and _why_
* **Practices** describe _how a pattern might be applied_
* **Playbooks** describe _how multiple practices interact over time_

This library intentionally stays at the pattern level.

***

## In Summary

Patterns are not solutions to be installed.

They are lenses through which to see systems more clearly.

Use them with curiosity, not compliance.
