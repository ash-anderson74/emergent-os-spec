# High-Integrity Commitments

## Context

Organizations require commitments for certain obligations—regulatory, legal, safety, or contractual.

Yet commitments are often made before uncertainty is resolved.

## Problem

Commitments based on estimates rather than evidence lead to:

- missed expectations
- reactive firefighting
- compromised quality
- erosion of trust
- fear-driven planning

Certainty is assumed where none exists.

## Forces

- Stakeholders demand assurance
- Teams need time to reduce uncertainty
- Early commitment feels decisive
- Learning is perceived as delay
- Failure damages credibility

## Solution

Make commitments **only after sufficient learning has occurred**.

High-integrity commitments:

- are outcome-based
- are grounded in validated feasibility
- reflect reduced uncertainty
- constrain scope intentionally
- acknowledge what adaptability is sacrificed

Learning precedes commitment, not the other way around.

## Result

- Commitments become reliable
- Risk is reduced earlier
- Trust increases across the system
- Planning shifts from guessing to evidence

## Trade-offs

- Delays commitment until confidence exists
- Requires patience from leadership
- Demands explicit learning investment
