# Pattern: High Integrity Commitments

## Context

Your organization needs confidence in delivery for critical outcomes, but traditional commitments are based on estimates and assumptions. Teams often overpromise and underdeliver, eroding trust and creating tension between stakeholders and delivery teams.

## Problem

Deterministic planning forces teams to commit before uncertainty is resolved. This leads to missed deadlines, compromised quality, and reactive firefighting. Stakeholders lose trust, and teams feel pressured to guess rather than learn.

## Forces

* Stakeholders want certainty for high-priority initiatives.
* Teams need time to validate feasibility and reduce risk.
* Pressure to commit early undermines experimentation and learning.
* Failure to deliver damages credibility and morale.

## Solution

Introduce **High Integrity Commitments** as a practice within EmergentOS. Teams make commitments only after **validated discovery** and **technical feasibility** checks. These commitments are tied to **outcomes**, not outputs, and are **supported by evidence from prototypes, spikes, and telemetry**. Leadership enables this by creating space for Slowification—time for practice and learning before execution.

## Result

Commitments become reliable and meaningful. Stakeholders gain confidence without sacrificing adaptability. Teams deliver with integrity, knowing they have validated assumptions and reduced uncertainty. Trust grows, and planning shifts from guesswork to evidence-based confidence.
