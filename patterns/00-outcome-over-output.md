# Outcome Over Output

## Context

Organizations working in uncertain environments often default to measuring activity because it is visible, predictable, and easy to report.

Outputs—features delivered, stories completed, deadlines met—provide the comfort of progress, even when their relationship to customer or business value is unclear.

## Problem

When success is measured by outputs, teams optimize for delivery volume rather than impact.

This leads to:

- feature-heavy roadmaps with weak value signals
- local optimization that degrades system performance
- pressure to “deliver” regardless of learning
- delayed discovery of whether work actually matters

Output focus creates the **illusion of progress** while masking risk.

## Forces

- Leaders need visibility and assurance
- Teams want clarity on what “good” looks like
- Outcomes are harder to attribute than outputs
- Learning creates ambiguity and discomfort
- Measurement systems reward what is easy to count

## Solution

Shift focus from *what is produced* to *what changes*.

Frame work in terms of:

- intended outcomes
- observable behavioural or system change
- hypotheses about value
- evidence rather than completion

Delivery still matters, but it is treated as a **means**, not an end.

Practices such as outcome-oriented goals, visual flow management, and experimentation can support this pattern—but none are required in specific form.

## Result

- Teams reason about impact, not just throughput
- Learning happens earlier and more safely
- Work that does not move outcomes is stopped sooner
- Strategic conversations reference evidence, not activity

## Trade-offs

- Outcomes are harder to predict and attribute
- Short-term certainty may decrease
- Requires leadership comfort with ambiguity
