# Pattern: Work Visualization

## Context

Teams and leaders struggle to understand what is in progress, what is blocked, and what is next. Work is hidden in spreadsheets, status reports, or siloed tools. Conversations focus on deadlines rather than flow, and improvement opportunities remain invisible.

## Problem

Without visibility, teams lose focus and alignment. Bottlenecks go unnoticed; dependencies cause delays, and leadership resorts to micromanagement for control. Transparency is low; trust erodes, and predictability suffers.

## Forces

* Stakeholders want clarity and progress updates.
* Teams need autonomy but fear being blindsided by hidden work.
* Leaders want to manage risk without adding overhead.
* Existing reporting systems are static and outdated.

## Solution

Make work visible using **Kanban boards** at both team and portfolio levels. Visualize discovery, delivery, and improvement tracks. Apply **WIP limits** to prevent overload and highlight flow health. Use **flow metrics** (cycle time, throughput, aging work) to guide conversations. Portfolio Kanban provides systemic visibility, enabling leaders to coach through flow—not control through timelines.

## Result

Transparency improves alignment and trust. Teams gain clarity on priorities and blockers. Leaders shift from enforcing deadlines to enabling flow. Conversations become evidence-based, focusing on outcomes and improvement rather than status reporting.
