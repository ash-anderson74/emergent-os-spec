# Maintaining the Big Picture

## Context

Teams often struggle to understand how their work connects to broader organizational goals.

Without shared context, effort fragments and alignment erodes.

## Problem

Lack of systemic visibility leads to:

- disconnected priorities
- duplicated effort
- local optimization
- difficulty explaining value
- strategy becoming abstract and distant

Teams execute without understanding why.

## Forces

- Strategy is often communicated abstractly
- Complexity increases with scale
- Visibility tools focus on delivery, not intent
- Leaders assume alignment exists

## Solution

Make strategic intent explicit and visible.

This involves:

- clarifying strategic outcomes
- mapping how work contributes to them
- visualizing hypotheses and dependencies
- connecting team goals to system-level intent

Alignment emerges through shared understanding, not enforcement.

## Result

- Teams see how their work matters
- Prioritization becomes easier
- Strategy becomes tangible
- Adaptation preserves coherence

## Trade-offs

- Requires ongoing conversation
- Visual models must evolve
- Misalignment becomes visible sooner
