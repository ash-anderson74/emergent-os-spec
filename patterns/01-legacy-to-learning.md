# Pattern: From Legacy Control to Learning Systems

## Context

Your organization is replacing a legacy system with a new platform. The work appears predictable—re-implementing known features—but hidden complexity, integration challenges, and outdated assumptions threaten delivery confidence.

## Problem

Teams assume the work is deterministic and plan using fixed milestones. But legacy systems are poorly documented; dependencies are unclear, and parity does not guarantee value. Delivery slips, and learning is lost.

## Forces

* Stakeholders expect certainty and parity.
* Teams face hidden complexity and integration risks.
* Legacy behaviour is often undocumented or misunderstood.
* Pressure to deliver quickly undermines discovery and validation.

## Solution

Run EmergentOS to shift from deterministic reimplementation to outcome-driven migration. Use OKRs to define strategic outcomes (e.g. reduced support tickets, improved performance). Run validated discovery to confirm feasibility before committing. Use Kanban to visualize migration flow and Lean Kata to improve delivery. Empower teams to make high-integrity commitments based on evidence.

## Result

Migration becomes iterative, resilient, and outcome focused. Teams uncover hidden risks early, validate assumptions, and deliver with confidence. Legacy is replaced not just with parity—but with learning, improvement, and measurable impact.
