# Who Does What by How Much

## Context

Organizations adopt outcome-oriented goal frameworks to shift focus away from outputs.

However, teams often struggle to express outcomes clearly and measurably.

## Problem

Poorly articulated goals result in:

- vague aspirations without direction
- key results that describe activity, not impact
- metrics that fail to guide learning
- weak connection between strategy and execution

Outcome language exists, but meaning is lost.

## Forces

- Stakeholders demand measurable progress
- Teams want clarity without micromanagement
- Behavioural change is harder to quantify than delivery
- Pressure for speed encourages task-based goals

## Solution

Express outcomes in terms of **observable change**.

A useful structure is:

- **Who** is affected
- **Does What** behaviour or capability changes
- **By How Much** measurable difference indicates success

This framing shifts goals from intent to testable hypotheses.

## Result

- Outcomes become concrete and measurable
- Teams understand what success actually means
- Progress supports learning, not reporting
- Strategy connects to behaviour and impact

## Trade-offs

- Requires discipline in goal formulation
- Behavioural metrics may lag delivery signals
- Not all outcomes are immediately measurable

- Measure What Matters
- Outcome Over Output
- Operate Around Outcomes
