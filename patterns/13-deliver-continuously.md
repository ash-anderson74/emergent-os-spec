# Continuous Delivery

## Context

Organizations aim to deliver value quickly but are constrained by infrequent releases, late integration, and fragile deployment processes.

## Problem

When delivery is batch-oriented:

- risk accumulates
- feedback arrives too late
- quality degrades
- learning slows
- teams become change-averse

Big releases optimize for efficiency over learning.

## Forces

- Stakeholders want speed and stability
- Teams fear breaking production
- Manual processes increase risk
- Late integration hides defects
- Experimentation feels unsafe

## Solution

Design delivery systems for small, reversible changes.

Continuous delivery emphasizes:

- reducing batch size
- integrating work frequently
- making change safe
- shortening feedback loops

Delivery becomes a tool for learning, not just execution.

## Result

- Risk is reduced continuously
- Feedback accelerates decision-making
- Quality improves through early detection
- Innovation becomes safer and faster

## Trade-offs

- Requires investment in automation and discipline
- Exposes technical debt early
- Demands cultural shift toward shared ownership
