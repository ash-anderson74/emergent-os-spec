# Meaningful Measurement

## Context

Organizations want evidence-based decision-making but often rely on metrics that optimize activity rather than learning or outcomes.

## Problem

When metrics are used as targets:

- behavior is distorted
- learning is suppressed
- teams game numbers
- trust erodes
- performance degrades

Measurement shifts from insight to enforcement.

## Forces

- Leaders need signals of progress
- Teams fear punitive measurement
- Traditional metrics emphasize output
- Correlation is mistaken for causation
- Good metrics are harder to explain

## Solution

Use metrics as **signals**, not goals.

Meaningful measurement:

- tracks trends over time
- balances speed, quality, and stability
- supports coaching conversations
- informs improvement experiments

Metrics exist to ask better questions, not to score performance.

## Result

- Decisions become evidence-based
- Improvement efforts become targeted
- Trust increases around data
- Performance improves sustainably

## Trade-offs

- Metrics may challenge existing narratives
- Interpretation requires discipline
- Signal lag can frustrate stakeholders
