# Emergent Operating Model

> **Status:** Emergent Operating Model v1 — Frozen Specification  
> Emergent Operating Model is stable. Evolution is governed by the policy defined in [EVOLUTION.md](./spec/EVOLUTION.md).

Emergent Operating Model (EOM) is a **non-prescriptive operating model for adaptability** in complex socio-technical environments.

It synthesizes recurring patterns observed across Lean, DevOps, product discovery, and organizational design literature into a single, coherent operating model—without freezing those patterns into dogma.

Emergent Operating Model is not a framework, methodology, or maturity model.  
It defines **constraints and operating logic**, not steps to follow.

## What Emergent Operating Model Is

Emergent Operating Model is designed for organizations operating under uncertainty, where:

- outcomes cannot be predicted upfront
- learning reduces risk more effectively than planning
- flow reveals system health
- team autonomy must coexist with strategic alignment
- governance must guide without controlling

EOM provides:

- a stable **specification** (what must remain true)
- a **field guide** (how those ideas commonly show up)
- **practice playbooks** (concrete, non-prescriptive guidance)
- **patterns and anti-patterns** (recurring system dynamics)
- **essays** for sense-making and guardrail-setting

## What Emergent Operating Model Is Not

Emergent Operating Model explicitly resists becoming:

- a delivery framework
- a transformation methodology
- a maturity model
- a certification scheme
- a checklist or “playbook factory”
- a prescriptive scaling approach

If you are looking for a framework to adopt or roll out, Emergent Operating Model is probably not what you want.

## How to Read This Repository

Different readers should start in different places.

### 📐 If you want to understand the operating model

Start here:

- [/spec/README.md](./spec/README.md)
- [/spec/00-introduction.md](./spec/00-introduction.md)

The specification defines the **constraints, principles, and boundaries** of Emergent Operating Model.

---

### 🧭 If you want to understand how Emergent Operating Model works in practice

Start here:

- [/field-guide/00-from-patterns-to-operating-system.md](/field-guide/00-from-patterns-to-operating-system.md)

The Field Guide explains the **operating logic** behind Emergent Operating Model and how recurring practices fit together—without prescribing them.

---

### 🛠 If you are applying specific techniques

Explore:

- [/field-guide/practice-playbooks](./field-guide/practice-playbooks)

These playbooks provide **EOM-aligned guidance** for commonly used practices (e.g. OKRs, discovery, flow metrics, funding), including examples and anti-patterns.

---

### 🧠 If you want reusable insights

Browse:

- [/patterns](./patterns)
- [/patterns/anti-patterns](./patterns/anti-patterns)

Patterns describe **recurring system conditions**.  
Anti-patterns describe **reliable failure modes**.

Both are portable beyond Emergent Operating Model.

### 📚 If you want lineage and sources

See:

- [/references](./references)

Emergent Operating Model is a synthesis, not an invention.

---

### ✍️ If you want to understand the “why”

Read:

- [/essays](./essays/)

Essays explain why Emergent Operating Model deliberately avoids certain familiar levers (e.g. alignment theatre, prescriptive team models, maturity stages).

## Versioning and Stability

Emergent Operating Model v1 is **frozen**.

- The specification is stable
- Changes require evidence and discipline
- Accumulation without coherence is explicitly resisted

See [EVOLUTION.md](./spec/EVOLUTION.md) for details.

## Contribution Philosophy

Contributions are welcome when they:

- strengthen coherence
- clarify intent
- surface real failure modes
- respect non-prescriptiveness
- preserve learning and adaptability

Contributions that aim to:

- add practices
- enforce compliance
- standardize behavior
- introduce maturity levels

will be rejected by design.

## Closing Note

Emergent Operating Model does not aim to be complete.

It aims to be **coherent**.

If you find yourself wishing it specified *what to do next*, that tension is intentional. Emergent Operating Model exists to help organizations reason more clearly under uncertainty—not to remove the need for thinking.
