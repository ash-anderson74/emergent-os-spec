# Facilitation Guide: Using Diagnostics in Portfolio and Governance Reviews

#### Purpose

This guide supports the use of **EOM diagnostics** in portfolio and governance forums to improve **investment quality and learning**, not to tighten control.

It helps leaders detect **systemic risk patterns** without reverting to approval gates or performance management.

***

### What Portfolio Diagnostics Are For

Portfolio-level diagnostics are used to:

* understand how investment decisions are being made
* detect where certainty is being manufactured
* reveal where learning is being crowded out
* identify constraints shaping behaviour across teams

They are **not** for:

* prioritisation
* ranking initiatives
* evaluating team competence
* enforcing delivery commitments

Those uses collapse learning immediately.

***

### Reframing Governance Conversations

Before introducing diagnostics, the facilitator must reset expectations.

Suggested framing:

> _“This review is not about progress reporting or justification._\
> &#xNAN;_&#x49;t’s about understanding what the system is learning — and what it is pretending to know.”_

This reframing is essential.

Without it, diagnostics will be experienced as interrogation.

***

### How Diagnostics Work at Portfolio Level

At portfolio level, diagnostics are **pattern-oriented**, not initiative-specific.

They surface questions such as:

* Where are we repeatedly committing before learning?
* Which types of work produce the most confidence inflation?
* What decisions are hardest to reverse?
* Where does risk consistently show up too late?
* What behaviour does our funding model reward?

Avoid drilling into individual teams unless they explicitly invite it.

***

### Facilitation Techniques That Preserve Safety

#### Aggregate first, then zoom (if needed)

Start with trends:

* “Across initiatives…”
* “Over the last two quarters…”
* “In this class of work…”

Only move to specifics if:

* the system pattern is understood
* the team involved feels safe
* learning is the explicit goal

***

#### Separate learning from continuation decisions

Diagnostics must **never** be immediately tied to funding withdrawal or escalation.

If learning leads directly to punishment, learning will stop.

Explicitly decouple:

* “What did we learn?”\
  from
* “What do we do next?”

They may happen in the same forum, but not the same moment.

***

### What Leaders Should Listen For

Healthy signals:

* leaders admitting uncertainty
* stopping work being normalised
* teams requesting learning investment
* reduced demand for precision
* evidence reshaping strategy

Unhealthy signals:

* pressure to “commit anyway”
* defensiveness around sunk cost
* fixation on spend vs value
* translating learning into targets
* asking teams to “prove” readiness

These are signals of **fear re-entering the system**.

***

### The Role of Authority (Explicit but Limited)

Senior authority has a role — but not the one leaders expect.

Authority is used to:

* protect learning time
* prevent premature commitment
* legitimise stopping
* adjust system-level constraints

Authority is **not** used to:

* override evidence
* demand certainty
* accelerate decisions
* enforce delivery narratives

If authority is applied incorrectly, diagnostics will be silenced.

***

### Closing a Portfolio Diagnostic Well

A good portfolio diagnostic ends with:

* clearer uncertainty
* fewer illusions
* adjusted investment posture
* explicit next learning steps
* improved optionality

It does **not** end with:

* stronger plans
* more reporting
* tighter controls
* cosmetic reassurance

Reassurance without learning is a liability.

***

### In Summary

Portfolio diagnostics help leaders see:

* what the organisation is optimising for
* how fear shapes control
* where learning is being suppressed
* which constraints must change next

Used well, diagnostics replace control with **earned confidence**.

Used poorly, they become another compliance ritual.

The difference is not the tool —\
it is the **intent and safety with which it is used**.
