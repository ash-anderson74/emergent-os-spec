# Facilitation Guide: Using Diagnostics in Product Planning Conversations

#### Purpose

This guide supports facilitators, product leaders, and portfolio owners in using **EOM diagnostics** during **planning conversations** without creating fear, defensiveness, or false certainty.

It exists to help teams **surface risk and assumptions early** — not to justify plans, assess performance, or accelerate commitment.

This is not a planning method.\
It is a **sense-making aid**.

***

### When This Guide Is Appropriate

Use diagnostics in planning conversations when:

* work appears “obvious” or “well understood”
* timelines are being requested before learning has occurred
* teams are asked to commit based on confidence rather than evidence
* dependencies are assumed rather than explored
* plans feel brittle but hard to challenge

Do **not** use diagnostics:

* to approve or reject plans
* to score teams
* to compare teams
* to enforce standardisation
* in environments where psychological safety is visibly absent

***

### The Facilitator’s Posture

The facilitator’s role is **not** to extract answers.

It is to:

* slow the system down
* legitimise uncertainty
* shift the conversation from delivery to understanding
* protect participants from consequence while learning emerges

You are not leading the group _to_ a conclusion.\
You are creating conditions for **shared clarity**.

***

### Framing the Diagnostic (Critical)

How you introduce the diagnostic determines whether learning is possible.

Recommended framing:

> _“We’re not here to finalise scope or timing._\
> &#xNAN;_&#x57;e’re here to understand what we know, emphasise what we don’t, and decide where learning is needed before commitment.”_

Explicitly state:

* there are no right answers
* uncertainty is expected
* identifying risk is valued
* stopping or reshaping work is a legitimate outcome

If this framing feels unsafe to say out loud, **do not proceed**.

***

### How to Ask Diagnostic Questions

#### Ask questions as invitations, not tests

Good:

* “Where might we be borrowing confidence from earlier systems?”
* “What would we need to learn before this estimate becomes meaningful?”

Bad:

* “Why hasn’t this been thought through?”
* “Who owns this dependency?”
* “What’s the risk rating?”

***

#### Let silence do work

If questions are met with pause, that is **learning beginning**, not failure.

Do not rush to fill silence.\
Do not interpret uncertainty as incompetence.

***

#### Name systemic patterns, not individual gaps

Redirect from:

* “This team hasn’t analysed dependencies”

Toward:

* “What makes it hard for any team to see these dependencies early?”

You are diagnosing **the system**, not the people inside it.

***

### What to Watch For (Signals)

Positive signals:

* assumptions being spoken out loud
* confidence being revised downward
* scope being reframed as provisional
* work being sliced to reduce risk
* teams asking for time to learn first

Warning signals:

* defensiveness
* performance narratives
* premature solutions
* pressure to “just commit”
* turning questions into action items

If warning signals appear, pause.\
That is diagnostic data.

***

### Ending the Conversation Well

A diagnostic session should end with **clarity**, not certainty.

Healthy outcomes include:

* agreed areas of uncertainty
* explicit learning goals
* reduced scope
* delayed commitment
* reframed success criteria

Unhealthy outcomes include:

* a new plan
* tighter estimates
* forced agreement
* disguised decisions

If a firm commitment is made, explicitly ask:

> _“What learning have we earned that makes this commitment responsible?”_

If no one can answer clearly, the system is moving too fast.

***

### Common Misuse to Actively Prevent

* Turning diagnostics into a checklist
* Capturing answers as evidence of readiness
* Treating uncertainty as weakness
* Using diagnostics to justify pre-made decisions

If this happens, **stop using the diagnostic**.\
You are doing harm.

***

### In Summary

Diagnostics in planning conversations exist to:

* collapse risk early
* expose false certainty
* legitimise learning
* prevent premature commitment

They are effective only when **safety is explicit** and **outcomes are open**.

Your job is not to move planning forward.

Your job is to ensure the system does not demand certainty before learning has occurred.
