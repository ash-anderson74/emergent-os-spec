# Facilitation Guides

Facilitation Guides support **sense-making at system level** within the Emergent Operating Model (EOM).

They are not workshops, training materials, or implementation playbooks.

They exist to help leaders and operators **surface, examine, and reason about system constraints** that shape organisational behaviour—especially where power, risk, and accountability distort learning.

## Purpose

Facilitation Guides are designed to:

- make implicit system dynamics explicit
- slow decision-making long enough for insight to emerge
- reveal where learning does — and does not — influence action
- support shared understanding without forcing agreement
- protect EOM from being reduced to prescription or rollout

They are used **with** diagnostics, not instead of them.

## How These Guides Differ from Other EOM Material

### Compared to the Specification

- The spec defines **what must remain true**
- Facilitation guides explore **where it is currently not true**

### Compared to Practice Playbooks

- Playbooks provide *how-to guidance*
- Facilitation guides provide *how-to-see guidance*

### Compared to Essays

- Essays explain *why the system behaves as it does*
- Facilitation guides create conditions to *see that behaviour live*

## Intended Audience

Facilitation Guides are written for:

- executive teams
- senior leadership groups
- EOM operators
- internal coaches or facilitators with organisational credibility

They are **not** designed for large group rollout or cascade.

Most guides assume:

- power asymmetry in the room
- psychological safety is fragile
- defensive narratives will appear quickly
- truth emerges only when pace is slowed deliberately

## Design Principles

All facilitation guides follow these principles:

- **No prescriptions**  
  They do not mandate actions or outputs.

- **No scoring or metrics**  
  Insight, not measurement, is the goal.

- **No forced alignment**  
  Disagreement is diagnostic.

- **No immediate fixing**  
  Insight precedes intervention.

- **Minimal artefacts**  
  The system, not the slide deck, is under examination.

## Using Facilitation Guides Responsibly

Facilitation Guides should be used:

- as mirrors, not levers
- to surface constraints, not assign blame
- to legitimise learning, not manufacture buy-in

They are most effective when:

- participation is voluntary
- the facilitator is trusted
- leaders agree to stay with discomfort
- outcomes are not pre-decided

Used poorly, they will produce:

- narrative alignment
- performative insight
- premature action
- system reinforcement rather than change

## Current Guides

- **Facilitating Executive Learning Boundaries**  
  A guided session to surface where incremental and reversible commitment gives way to fixed, defensive commitment—and why.

Additional guides may be added where recurring system-level tensions justify them.

## Final Note

Facilitation Guides are part of the Field Guide because **systems cannot be redesigned from prose alone**.

They exist to help leaders experience—rather than merely understand—the consequences of the systems they inhabit and shape.

In EOM terms, they help organisations learn where learning stops.
