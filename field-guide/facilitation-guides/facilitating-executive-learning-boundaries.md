# Facilitating Executive Learning Boundaries

*An EOM Sense-Making Session on Commitment, Risk, and Reversibility*  

---

## Purpose of This Session

This facilitation guide supports a structured executive conversation about **where learning currently stops influencing decisions** in the organisation.

It is designed to accompany the diagnostic:

> **Incremental & Reversible Commitment (Executive Diagnostic)**

This session does not aim to:

- approve plans
- produce actions
- evaluate performance
- align narratives

Its sole purpose is to **make the system visible**.

---

## What This Session Is — and Is Not

This is **not**:

- a workshop
- a transformation initiative
- a governance review
- a decision forum
- a coaching intervention

This **is**:

- a system mirror
- a shared sense-making space
- a way to surface hidden constraints
- a deliberate slowing of executive cognition

---

## Intended Audience

- Executive teams
- Senior leadership groups
- Board subcommittees (strategy, investment, transformation)

Ideal group size:

- 6–12 participants

Duration:

- 60–90 minutes

---

## Preconditions for Use

Do **not** run this session if:

- decisions have already been made and need validation
- the session is expected to produce actions
- participation is coerced
- leaders are evaluated on “alignment”
- the facilitator is not trusted

The system will defend itself if pushed.

---

## Facilitator Posture

The facilitator must:

- remain neutral and curious
- resist summarising prematurely
- slow the room intentionally
- interrupt narrative consolidation
- protect silence
- avoid reframing discomfort as misunderstanding

This is a **containment role**, not a leadership one.

## Session Structure

### 1. Framing the Session (10 minutes)

Suggested opening:

> “This is not a planning, approval, or governance session.  
> We’re here to examine **where learning is allowed to change direction — and where it isn’t**.”

Establish explicit ground rules:

- no attribution outside the room
- no commitment to action
- no obligation to agree
- honesty over optimism

---

### 2. Silent Diagnostic Completion (10–15 minutes)

Participants complete the **Incremental & Reversible Commitment diagnostic** individually.

Rules:

- no discussion
- no clarification questions
- answer for *how the system behaves*, not how it should

Silence is intentional.  
It prevents early narrative convergence.

---

### 3. Pattern Recognition (15–20 minutes)

Do **not** review answers one by one.

Instead, ask:

- “Which questions were hardest to answer honestly?”
- “Where did answers feel uncomfortable?”
- “Where do you suspect answers differ most across this room?”

Avoid:

- voting
- scoring
- averaging

You are looking for **tension**, not consensus.

---

### 4. Identifying the Learning Boundary (15 minutes)

Introduce the central question:

> **“At what point does learning stop being allowed to change direction here?”**

Then explore gently:

- “What makes that boundary feel fixed?”
- “What becomes personally risky at that point?”
- “What shifts from learning to defensibility?”

Let silence work.

This is often the most revealing moment.

---

### 5. Constraint Reflection (15 minutes)

Introduce EOM language sparingly:

- reversibility
- exposure
- sunk narrative
- public commitment
- defensibility

Ask:

> “Which of these constraints are designed — and which are inherited?”

Key framing:

- This is not about who created them.
- It is about what they currently permit.

---

### 6. Closing Reflection (5 minutes)

Invite (voluntary) completion of this sentence:

> “In this organisation, reversibility typically ends when…”

No discussion.
No rebuttal.
No fixing.

The sentence itself is the output.

---

## What Not To Do During the Session

Do **not**:

- capture actions
- create follow-up tasks
- propose pilots
- debate feasibility
- reassure discomfort away

That collapses learning back into control.

---

## After the Session

Explicitly state:

> “No changes are required as a result of this session.”

Possible *later* follow-ups (outside the session):

- funding tranche design review
- governance question redesign
- commitment signalling norms
- public vs private decision thresholds

Only if leaders choose to proceed.

---

## Common Failure Modes

This session fails when:

- leaders seek reassurance
- discomfort is reframed as misunderstanding
- facilitation rushes to synthesis
- insights are converted into initiatives
- someone tries to “own” the outcome

Failure here usually signals that **defensibility still dominates learning**.

That, too, is insight.

---

## Why This Session Matters in EOM

EOM assumes:

> People behave rationally within the constraints of the operating system they inhabit.

This session helps leaders see:

- where they are constrained
- where learning becomes unsafe
- where commitment hardens prematurely

It does not force change.

It creates the **conditions under which change might later become rational**.

That is sufficient.

## Final Note

This session does not produce certainty.

It produces **clarity**.

In complex systems, that is the only legitimate starting point.
