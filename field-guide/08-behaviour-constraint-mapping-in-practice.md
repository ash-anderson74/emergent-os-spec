# Facilitation Guide: Behaviour Constraint Mapping in Practice

This guide describes how Emergent Operating Model (EOM) operators facilitate system insight. It is not a required method, process, or practice.

***

This guide supports EOM operators in facilitating conversations that shift focus from behaviour correction to system redesign.

It is deliberately lightweight. Its purpose is sensemaking — not diagnosis, judgement, or solution design.

***

## When to Use This

Use this facilitation approach when you observe:

* persistent “undesirable” behaviours
* repeated failure of process changes to stick
* defensiveness, blame, or narrative control
* disagreement about “what the real problem is”
* pressure to train, mandate, or enforce behaviour change

These are signals that the system — not the people — needs examination.

***

## Framing the Session

Begin by establishing a shared premise:

> _We are not here to fix people or defend decisions._\
> &#xNAN;_&#x57;e are here to understand what conditions make the current behaviour sensible._

Make it explicit that:

* no behaviour will be judged
* no solutions are required today
* uncertainty is expected
* learning is the primary outcome

This framing is essential for psychological safety.

***

## Step 1: Name the Behaviour Neutrally

Ask the group to describe **what is happening**, not why it is happening.

Good prompts:

* “What do we reliably see happening?”
* “What behaviour repeats, even after intervention?”
* “What do people do when under pressure?”

Capture statements factually, without adjectives.

Example:

> “Teams produce detailed delivery plans before validating assumptions.”

***

## Step 2: Shift the Question

Explicitly redirect the inquiry:

Instead of:

> “Why are people doing this?”

Ask:

> **“What conditions make this the safest or most reasonable option?”**

If people revert to intent or attitude, gently redirect:

* “What makes that response rational?”
* “What happens if they don’t behave this way?”
* “What risk does this behaviour reduce?”

***

## Step 3: Surface Constraints, Not Opinions

As answers emerge, listen for **conditions**, such as:

* approval requirements
* reporting expectations
* funding or budget rules
* performance evaluation criteria
* escalation or blame pathways
* timing of commitment relative to learning

If a statement refers to a person or role, ask:

> “What are _they_ responding to?”

Translate answers into system language.

***

## Step 4: Reframe the Behaviour

Once constraints are visible, restate the situation as:

> _Given these conditions, this behaviour is a rational response._

Pause here.

This is often the moment where defensiveness drops and insight appears.

Do not rush to solutions.

***

## Step 5: Identify Changeable Conditions

Only if the group is ready, ask:

* “Which condition most strongly reinforces this behaviour?”
* “Which one could plausibly change?”
* “What would make a different behaviour less risky?”

Focus on:

* removing the need for the behaviour
* legitimising alternatives (e.g. learning before commitment)
* changing what the system accepts or rewards

Avoid:

* telling teams what to do differently
* introducing new rules immediately
* designing comprehensive fixes

Small constraint shifts are sufficient.

***

## Step 6: Close With Learning, Not Action

End the session by capturing:

* what the system currently optimises for
* which constraints matter most
* what surprised the group
* what questions remain open

Action may follow later — but **insight is the outcome**.

***

## Facilitator Reminders

* Persistent behaviour implies protection
* Resistance signals rational optimisation
* Silence indicates risk, not apathy
* Constraints explain more than intentions
* Learning precedes redesign

If the conversation becomes personal, slow it down and return to:

> _“What condition makes this reasonable?”_

***

## EOM Alignment

This facilitation approach enacts the EOM anchor directly:

> **To change behaviour, you must change the system that makes that behaviour rational.**

It looks for **conditions to change**, not causes to remove.

And by doing so, it makes new behaviour possible without enforcement.

***

## Worked example: Deterministic planning & estimation

**Observed behaviour**\
Product teams spend several days each quarter estimating work, sequencing it into a roadmap, and defending delivery dates — despite high uncertainty and repeated plan failure.

***

### Step 1: Name the behaviour (neutral)

> “Teams estimate epics and stories and construct sequenced quarterly plans before any meaningful discovery or validation occurs.”

No judgement. No adjectives. No blame.

***

### Step 2: Shift the question

Facilitator explicitly reframes:

> “Rather than asking why teams are doing this, let’s ask:\
> **What conditions make this behaviour the safest or most reasonable option available?**”

This single sentence is the pivot.

***

### Step 3: Explore constraints (constraint-focused inquiry)

Conversation unfolds roughly like this:

* **Why do teams estimate in such detail?**\
  → Because they are expected to commit to delivery dates.
* **Why are delivery dates required at that stage?**\
  → Because leadership needs predictability for funding and coordination.
* **Why does predictability come from estimates rather than learning?**\
  → Because our governance and reporting expect forward certainty.
* **What happens if teams say “we don’t know yet”?**\
  → They are perceived as unprepared or untrustworthy.
* **What risk does estimation reduce?**\
  → It reduces the risk of appearing incompetent or out of control.

At this point, something important becomes visible:

> Estimation is not about accuracy.\
> It is about **legitimacy and safety**.

***

### Step 4: Reframe the behaviour

The facilitator restates:

> “Given that credibility is assessed by certainty,\
> and uncertainty is penalised,\
> producing detailed estimates early is a rational survival strategy.”

This is often the moment when:

* defensiveness drops
* blame dissipates
* learning begins

Nothing has been “fixed”.\
But the system has been seen.

***

### Step 5: Identify leverage (constraint adjustment, not solutions)

Only now does the group explore possibility:

* What would count as _credible evidence_ other than estimates?
* What learning could reduce uncertainty before commitment?
* Where could we permit “not knowing yet” without penalty?
* What decision currently happens too early?

Examples of **constraint shifts**, not prescriptions:

* accepting learning evidence as valid planning input
* separating aspiration from commitment
* delaying commitment until discovery has occurred

No roadmap is created.\
No action list is required.

The group leaves with **shared system insight**.

***

### Step 6: Outcome

Even if nothing changes immediately:

* teams feel less “at fault”
* leaders see their own constraints
* future conversations shift from behaviour to design

And critically:

> Any subsequent change now targets **conditions**, not compliance.

That is an EOM success condition.
