# Facilitation Guide: Mapping Behaviour to System Constraints

This guide describes how EOS operators facilitate system insight. It is not a required method, process, or practice.

---

This guide supports EOS operators in facilitating conversations that shift focus
from behaviour correction to system redesign.

It is deliberately lightweight.
Its purpose is sensemaking — not diagnosis, judgement, or solution design.

---

## When to Use This

Use this facilitation approach when you observe:

- persistent “undesirable” behaviours
- repeated failure of process changes to stick
- defensiveness, blame, or narrative control
- disagreement about “what the real problem is”
- pressure to train, mandate, or enforce behaviour change

These are signals that the system — not the people — needs examination.

---

## Framing the Session

Begin by establishing a shared premise:

> *We are not here to fix people or defend decisions.*  
> *We are here to understand what conditions make the current behaviour sensible.*

Make it explicit that:

- no behaviour will be judged
- no solutions are required today
- uncertainty is expected
- learning is the primary outcome

This framing is essential for psychological safety.

## Step 1: Name the Behaviour Neutrally

Ask the group to describe **what is happening**, not why it is happening.

Good prompts:

- “What do we reliably see happening?”
- “What behaviour repeats, even after intervention?”
- “What do people do when under pressure?”

Capture statements factually, without adjectives.

Example:
> “Teams produce detailed delivery plans before validating assumptions.”

---

## Step 2: Shift the Question

Explicitly redirect the inquiry:

Instead of:
> “Why are people doing this?”

Ask:
> **“What conditions make this the safest or most reasonable option?”**

If people revert to intent or attitude, gently redirect:

- “What makes that response rational?”
- “What happens if they don’t behave this way?”
- “What risk does this behaviour reduce?”

---

## Step 3: Surface Constraints, Not Opinions

As answers emerge, listen for **conditions**, such as:

- approval requirements
- reporting expectations
- funding or budget rules
- performance evaluation criteria
- escalation or blame pathways
- timing of commitment relative to learning

If a statement refers to a person or role, ask:
> “What are *they* responding to?”

Translate answers into system language.

---

## Step 4: Reframe the Behaviour

Once constraints are visible, restate the situation as:

> *Given these conditions, this behaviour is a rational response.*

Pause here.

This is often the moment where defensiveness drops and insight appears.

Do not rush to solutions.

---

## Step 5: Identify Changeable Conditions

Only if the group is ready, ask:

- “Which condition most strongly reinforces this behaviour?”
- “Which one could plausibly change?”
- “What would make a different behaviour less risky?”

Focus on:

- removing the need for the behaviour
- legitimising alternatives (e.g. learning before commitment)
- changing what the system accepts or rewards

Avoid:

- telling teams what to do differently
- introducing new rules immediately
- designing comprehensive fixes

Small constraint shifts are sufficient.

---

## Step 6: Close With Learning, Not Action

End the session by capturing:

- what the system currently optimises for
- which constraints matter most
- what surprised the group
- what questions remain open

Action may follow later — but **insight is the outcome**.

---

## Facilitator Reminders

- Persistent behaviour implies protection
- Resistance signals rational optimisation
- Silence indicates risk, not apathy
- Constraints explain more than intentions
- Learning precedes redesign

If the conversation becomes personal, slow it down and return to:
> *“What condition makes this reasonable?”*

---

## EOS Alignment

This facilitation approach enacts the EOS anchor directly:

> **To change behaviour, you must change the system that makes that behaviour rational.**

It looks for **conditions to change**, not causes to remove.

And by doing so, it makes new behaviour possible without enforcement.
