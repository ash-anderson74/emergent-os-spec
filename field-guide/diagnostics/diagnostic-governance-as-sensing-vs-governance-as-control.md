# Diagnostic: Governance as Sensing vs Governance as Control

This diagnostic helps distinguish whether governance forums are functioning as **learning and sensing mechanisms**, or as **control and enforcement mechanisms**.

It is not a critique of individuals or intent.\
It is a way to surface how the system currently treats uncertainty, risk, and accountability.

***

### What This Diagnostic Examines

This diagnostic explores:

* how governance conversations are framed
* what information is surfaced or suppressed
* how uncertainty is handled
* how decisions evolve (or don’t) in response to evidence
* whether governance adapts the system or enforces it

***

### Diagnostic Questions

Use the questions below as prompts for observation and reflection — not as an assessment checklist.

#### 1. What Is the Primary Question Being Asked?

In governance forums, are leaders primarily asking:

* _“Are we on plan?”_
* _“Are we on track against commitments?”_
* _“Why is this late?”_

Or:

* _“What have we learned since the last review?”_
* _“What risks have become clearer?”_
* _“What assumptions have changed?”_

> If the dominant question is about adherence to plan rather than change in understanding, governance is operating as control rather than sensing.

***

#### 2. How Is Uncertainty Treated?

When uncertainty is raised:

* Is it welcomed as information?
* Or treated as a weakness, risk, or failure of preparation?

Signals of **control-oriented governance** include:

* pressure to “firm things up”
* requests for greater certainty without new evidence
* escalation due to ambiguity rather than risk

Signals of **sensing-oriented governance** include:

* curiosity about unknowns
* explicit discussion of confidence levels
* reframing uncertainty as a decision input, not a defect

***

#### 3. What Happens When Evidence Contradicts the Plan?

When new evidence emerges that challenges previous decisions:

* Is it explored and acted upon?
* Or defended against, deferred, or reframed?

Warning signs include:

* narrative adjustment to preserve the original plan
* selective use of metrics to justify continuation
* discomfort with changing direction once publicly committed

A sensing system expects direction to change.\
A control system treats change as loss of credibility.

***

#### 4. What Is Reviewed: Outcomes, Outputs, or Narratives?

Observe what artefacts dominate governance conversations:

* delivery status reports
* milestone tracking
* success narratives
* traffic lights and summaries

Versus:

* outcome trends
* learning summaries
* invalidated assumptions
* option value created or destroyed

> Governance that relies on narrative coherence rather than evidence coherence is functioning defensively.

***

#### 5. How Are Decisions Actually Made?

Ask quietly:

* Are decisions made _in_ the forum?
* Or before the forum, with the forum serving as performance theatre?

Control-oriented governance often:

* postpones real decisions
* preserves optionality for leaders but not teams
* creates the illusion of decisiveness without commitment

Sensing-oriented governance:

* makes fewer decisions
* but revisits them deliberately
* and adjusts them visibly when learning warrants it

***

#### 6. What Behaviour Does Governance Reward?

Look not at stated values, but at outcomes:

* Do teams get rewarded for hitting plans — even when learning was suppressed?
* Or for surfacing risk early — even when it disrupts expectations?

If raising problems consistently leads to:

* reduced trust
* increased scrutiny
* loss of autonomy

Then governance is functioning as control regardless of intent.

***

### Interpreting What You See

If governance is acting primarily as **control**:

* teams will optimise narratives
* uncertainty will be hidden
* learning will be delayed
* commitments will harden prematurely
* flow problems will be blamed on “dependencies”

If governance is acting as **sensing**:

* risk surfaces earlier
* decisions remain reversible longer
* funding adapts more frequently
* confidence increases _because_ uncertainty is visible
* behaviour changes without instruction

***

### Common Anti-Patterns This Diagnostic Reveals

* Governance forums as approval gates
* Status reporting replacing learning review
* Certainty demanded without evidence
* Metrics used defensively
* Decisions delayed to avoid visible reversals
* Accountability confused with control

***

### Using This Diagnostic Responsibly

This diagnostic is **not** a governance maturity assessment.

Do not use it to:

* rate leaders
* redesign forums immediately
* justify structural change

Use it to:

* notice system behaviour
* surface mismatches between intent and effect
* identify where governance increases fear rather than reducing risk

***

### Summary

Governance always shapes behaviour.

The only question is whether it is doing so by:

* enforcing certainty\
  or
* enabling learning

This diagnostic helps make that distinction visible — without assigning blame.
