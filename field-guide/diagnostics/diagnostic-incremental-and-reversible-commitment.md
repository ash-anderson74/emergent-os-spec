# Diagnostic: Incremental & Reversible Commitment

This diagnostic helps leaders assess whether their organisation genuinely permits **learning to influence decisions** — or whether commitments silently harden before uncertainty is reduced.

It is not a test of intent, maturity, or competence.\
It is a diagnostic of **system design under executive control**.

***

### Why This Matters

In complex environments, **the moment a decision becomes irreversible is the moment learning stops governing behaviour**.

Executives do not usually intend this.\
It emerges when accountability, funding, credibility, and reputation become coupled to early decisions.

This diagnostic surfaces where that coupling occurs.

***

### How to Use This Diagnostic

Answer each question **as the system actually behaves**, not as it is described.

Signals of risk are **systemic**, not personal.\
Discomfort is diagnostic.

***

### Section 1: Commitment Formation

**1. Before approving a major initiative, what must be true?**

* ⬜ Evidence has reduced key uncertainties
* ⬜ Hypotheses have been tested in practice
* ⬜ We understand what would cause us to stop
* ⬜ The initiative _must_ proceed regardless (external pressure, sunk narrative, reputation)

> Risk signal: Commitment justified by narrative, urgency, or prior signalling rather than learning.

***

**2. At what point does an initiative become “non-negotiable”?**

* ⬜ Never — we preserve optionality deliberately
* ⬜ After an initial learning phase
* ⬜ Once funding is approved
* ⬜ Once commitments are communicated externally
* ⬜ Once senior leaders have publicly endorsed it

> Risk signal: Irreversibility caused by visibility rather than evidence.

***

**3. What happens when new information contradicts the original decision?**

* ⬜ We pause and reassess investment
* ⬜ We revise scope but preserve direction
* ⬜ We look for compensating actions to stay on track
* ⬜ We question the data
* ⬜ We treat it as execution failure

> Risk signal: Learning is reinterpreted to protect the plan.

***

### Section 2: Funding and Economic Reversibility

**4. How is funding released?**

* ⬜ In small, reviewable tranches
* ⬜ In phases tied to learning milestones
* ⬜ Upfront, based on forecast and business case

> Risk signal: Funding mechanics enforce certainty before it is earned.

***

**5. What is the cost of stopping an initiative early?**

* ⬜ Minimal — stopping is an expected outcome of learning
* ⬜ Manageable, but uncomfortable
* ⬜ High — reputational, political, or financial
* ⬜ Prohibitive — stopping is considered failure

> Risk signal: Sunk cost logic embedded in governance.

***

**6. When investment continues despite weak evidence, why?**

* ⬜ Because learning suggests a better path
* ⬜ Because stopping would “look bad”
* ⬜ Because commitments have been made
* ⬜ Because budget is already allocated
* ⬜ Because changing course implies leadership error

> Risk signal: Continuation justified by optics rather than insight.

***

### Section 3: Accountability and Personal Risk

**7. Who bears the risk when an initiative is wrong?**

* ⬜ The system absorbs it
* ⬜ The decision-making group shares it
* ⬜ The delivery teams carry it
* ⬜ An individual executive carries it

> Risk signal: Learning suppressed to manage personal exposure.

***

**8. How safe is it for leaders to say “this was a bad call”?**

* ⬜ Routine and unremarkable
* ⬜ Acceptable with context
* ⬜ Rare and reputationally risky
* ⬜ Career-limiting

> Risk signal: Identity and credibility tied to infallibility.

***

**9. What is rewarded more consistently?**

* ⬜ Surfacing uncertainty early
* ⬜ Stopping unviable work
* ⬜ Delivering what was promised
* ⬜ Defending original decisions

> Risk signal: Behavioural incentives misaligned with learning.

***

### Section 4: Governance Signals

**10. What do governance forums pay most attention to?**

* ⬜ What have we learned?
* ⬜ How has risk changed?
* ⬜ Are assumptions still valid?
* ⬜ Are we on schedule?
* ⬜ Are we within budget?

> Risk signal: Governance reinforces prediction, not adaptation.

***

**11. When plans change, is governance curious or corrective?**

* ⬜ Curious: “What did we learn?”
* ⬜ Neutral: “Explain the delta”
* ⬜ Corrective: “How do we get back on plan?”
* ⬜ Punitive: “Why did you miss this?”

> Risk signal: Learning framed as deviation.

***

### Section 5: Executive Reflection

**12. Complete this sentence honestly:**

> _In this organisation, learning stops governing decisions once…_

(If the answer relates to budget approval, public commitment, or senior endorsement, that is the constraint.)

***

### Interpreting the Results

You are **not** looking for perfection.

You are looking for the **exact point where reversibility ends**.

That point defines the system’s true learning boundary.

If commitment hardens early:

* teams will optimise for defensibility
* plans will be protected
* metrics will be negotiated
* risk will surface late

If reversibility is preserved:

* learning accelerates
* bad news travels faster
* options expand instead of collapse

***

### Common Executive Misconception

> “If we keep things reversible, we lose control.”

In practice, the opposite is true.

Early irreversibility creates **false certainty** and **late surprises**.\
Incremental commitment creates **ongoing control through informed choice**.

***

### Closing Prompt for Leadership Teams

> **What decision would we allow ourselves to reverse — if we truly trusted learning?**

If that question feels uncomfortable, it is pointing directly at the constraint that must change.

That is where EOM work begins.
