# Diagnostic: Public Commitment & Narrative Debt

***

### Purpose of This Diagnostic

This diagnostic helps executive teams surface **where public commitments and organisational narratives begin to constrain learning**.

It is designed to reveal:

* how commitments harden socially
* how narratives accumulate “debt”
* where defensibility overtakes evidence
* why stopping or changing direction becomes increasingly difficult over time

It does **not** assess leadership quality, intent, or competence.

It examines **system behaviour**.

***

### What This Diagnostic Is — and Is Not

This diagnostic is **not**:

* a performance assessment
* a readiness score
* a maturity model
* a governance checklist
* a prompt for immediate action

It **is**:

* a mirror for organisational cognition
* a way to name invisible pressure
* a companion to learning-centred governance

***

### When to Use This Diagnostic

This diagnostic is particularly useful when:

* decisions feel “locked in” despite weak evidence
* stopping work feels harder than continuing
* strategy reviews feel performative
* bad news travels slowly or indirectly
* teams sense that narratives matter more than signals

***

### How to Use

* Complete **individually**, in silence
* Answer for **what happens**, not what should happen
* Do not average or score responses
* Discomfort is a valid and useful signal

***

### Diagnostic Questions

#### 1. Commitment Visibility

* Once an initiative is announced publicly (internally or externally), how easy is it to reverse or pause it without reputational cost?
* Are there different rules for changing direction **before** and **after** an announcement?
* Who decides when something becomes “public enough” to be hard to undo?

***

#### 2. Narrative Formation

* How quickly does an initiative acquire a story (e.g. _“this is strategic”, “this must succeed”_)?
* Who shapes that narrative most strongly?
* How often is the narrative revisited or revised in light of new evidence?

***

#### 3. Cost of Contradiction

* What happens to someone who challenges the prevailing narrative with evidence?
* Is contradiction seen as insight, risk, or disloyalty?
* Who feels safest raising disconfirming signals?

***

#### 4. Stopping Dynamics

* Under what conditions can work be stopped early and described as a success?
* Are stopped initiatives framed as learning—or as failure?
* How often are initiatives allowed to end without a replacement narrative?

***

#### 5. Narrative Debt Accumulation

* How often does the organisation continue work primarily to:
  * preserve credibility?
  * maintain consistency?
  * avoid explaining a change?
* Are past commitments cited as reasons to continue future investment?

***

#### 6. Decision Traceability

* Can leaders articulate **why** a decision is still valid—or only **what** was decided?
* Is evidence updated over time, or is the original rationale still referenced?
* What happens when current evidence contradicts the original narrative?

***

#### 7. Executive Exposure

* Who absorbs the reputational cost of changing direction?
* Is exposure shared, or concentrated?
* Are some roles structurally protected from narrative reversal?

***

#### 8. Relationship to Funding

* Does continued funding require new evidence—or continued belief?
* Are funding decisions explicitly tied to learning signals?
* How often does “we’ve already said we would” influence investment decisions?

***

### Reflection Prompts (Optional)

Use only if the group is ready.

* _“In this organisation, narratives become hard to challenge when…”_
* _“We are least able to change direction once…”_
* _“The safest thing to do when evidence shifts is…”_

Do **not** require answers from everyone.

***

### Interpreting What You See

Patterns to notice:

* silence around certain questions
* nervous laughter
* rapid justification
* deflection to external constraints
* attempts to normalise discomfort

These are **signals**, not problems.

***

### Relationship to EOM

Within the Emergent Operating Model:

* Public commitments are **constraints**
* Narratives are **coordination mechanisms**
* Narrative debt is a form of **irreversibility**
* Learning requires legitimacy **before** public certainty

This diagnostic helps reveal:

> **Where the organisation has traded reversibility for defensibility.**

***

### Common Misuse Patterns

This diagnostic is misused when:

* answers are debated
* reassurance replaces inquiry
* outcomes are demanded
* ownership is assigned
* narratives are “fixed” during the session

These responses usually confirm the diagnosis.

### Closing Note

Narratives are not inherently bad.

They are essential for coordination.

The risk emerges when narratives become **stronger than evidence**\
and **harder to revise than reality**.

This diagnostic exists to help leaders see where that shift occurs — so that learning can regain influence **before** the story becomes too expensive to change.
