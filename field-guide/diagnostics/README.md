# Field Guide: Diagnostics

Diagnostics are **sense-making tools**, not rules, standards, or assessments.

They exist to help practitioners *notice* when system behaviour has drifted away from stated intent — particularly in environments that claim to value learning, adaptability, and outcomes under uncertainty.

Diagnostics do **not**:

- prescribe practices  
- define compliance criteria  
- score teams or individuals  
- identify “good” or “bad” performers  

They are designed to surface **system signals**, not judge people.

## Purpose of Diagnostics in EOM

The Emergent Operating Model assumes:

> People behave rationally within the constraints of the system they inhabit.

When behaviour appears misaligned with intent, the cause is usually **system design**, not individual failure.

Diagnostics help answer questions such as:

- What behaviour does the system currently make safest?
- Where is learning being crowded out by certainty?
- Which constraints are shaping decisions in practice?
- Where have outputs become proxies for outcomes?
- Which anti-patterns are silently re-establishing themselves?

They help operators decide **where to look**, not **what to do next**.

## How Diagnostics Should Be Used

Diagnostics are intended to be used:

- collaboratively, not privately
- periodically, not continuously
- reflectively, not defensively

They work best when:

- read slowly  
- discussed openly  
- used as prompts for inquiry  
- applied at team, product, or system level  

They should not be used as checklists for enforcement or maturity assessment.

If a diagnostic feels uncomfortable, that discomfort is often the signal.

## What Diagnostics Are — and Are Not

**Diagnostics are:**

- qualitative and contextual
- indicator-based, not metric-based
- focused on patterns, not instances
- concerned with incentives and constraints
- safe to answer honestly (by design)

**Diagnostics are not:**

- audits
- health scores
- performance evaluations
- adoption gates
- transformation milestones

Using diagnostics as control mechanisms will distort behaviour and destroy their usefulness.

## Relationship to Other EOM Material

Diagnostics sit **between** essays and playbooks:

- **Essays** explore *why* certain behaviours and tensions recur  
- **Diagnostics** help recognise *where* those tensions are present  
- **Playbooks** offer examples of *how* constraints might be adjusted  

Diagnostics often reference:

- Patterns and anti-patterns  
- Core principles  
- System invariants  

But they never introduce new requirements.

## When Diagnostics Are Most Useful

Diagnostics are particularly valuable when:

- outcomes are not improving despite “doing the right things”
- delivery feels busy but learning feels thin
- planning effort is high but confidence remains low
- teams appear aligned but behaviour diverges
- leaders sense something is off but can’t name it yet

They are an aid for *seeing the system*, not fixing it.

---

## A Note on Responsibility

Diagnostics do not assign fault.

If a diagnostic consistently points in one direction, the most likely conclusion is:

> The system is working exactly as designed.

That is an invitation to **change constraints**, not to correct people.

## In Summary

Diagnostics help make invisible system dynamics visible.

They exist to:

- surface misalignment early
- reduce blame and defensiveness
- support shared sense-making
- guide deliberate system evolution

They are part of the Field Guide because **learning begins with noticing**.

Nothing in this section is mandatory.  
Everything in this section is informative.

Use them carefully.  
Use them together.  
And above all, use them with curiosity.
